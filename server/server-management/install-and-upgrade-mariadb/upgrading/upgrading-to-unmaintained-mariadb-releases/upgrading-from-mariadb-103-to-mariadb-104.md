# Upgrading from MariaDB 10.3 to MariaDB 10.4

### How to Upgrade

For Windows, see [Upgrading MariaDB on Windows](../upgrading-mariadb-on-windows.md) instead.

For MariaDB Galera Cluster, see [Upgrading from MariaDB 10.3 to MariaDB 10.4 with Galera Cluster](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/galera-management/upgrading-galera-cluster/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-3-to-mariadb-10-4-with-galera-cluster) instead.

Before you upgrade, it would be best to take a backup of your database. This is always a good idea to do before an upgrade. We would recommend [mariadb-backup](../../../../server-usage/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup/).

The suggested upgrade procedure is:

1. Modify the repository configuration, so the system's package manager installs [MariaDB 10.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/what-is-mariadb-104). For example,

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB APT repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#updating-the-mariadb-apt-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB YUM repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#updating-the-mariadb-yum-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Updating the MariaDB ZYpp repository to a New Major Release](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#updating-the-mariadb-zypp-repository-to-a-new-major-release) for more information.

1. [Stop MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
2. Uninstall the old version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo apt-get remove mariadb-server`
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo yum remove MariaDB-server`
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, execute the following:`sudo zypper remove MariaDB-server`

1. Install the new version of MariaDB.

* On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with APT](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-apt) for more information.
* On RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with YUM](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/yum.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-yum) for more information.
* On SLES, OpenSUSE, and other similar Linux distributions, see [Installing MariaDB Packages with ZYpp](../../installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/installing-mariadb-with-zypper.md#installing-mariadb-packages-with-zypp) for more information.

1. Make any desired changes to configuration options in [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md), such as `my.cnf`. This includes removing any options that are no longer supported.
2. [Start MariaDB](../../../starting-and-stopping-mariadb/starting-and-stopping-mariadb-automatically.md).
3. Run [mysql\_upgrade](../../../../clients-and-utilities/legacy-clients-and-utilities/mysql_upgrade.md).

* `mysql_upgrade` does two things:
  1. Ensures that the system tables in the [mysql database](../../../../reference/system-tables/the-mysql-database-tables/) are fully compatible with the new version.
  2. Does a very quick check of all tables and marks them as compatible with the new version of MariaDB .

### Incompatible Changes Between 10.3 and 10.4

On most servers upgrading from 10.3 should be painless. However, there are some things that have changed which could affect an upgrade:

#### Options That Have Changed Default Values

| Option                                                                                                                                                                 | Old default value | New default value                             |

#### Options That Have Been Removed or Renamed

The following options should be removed or renamed if you use them in your [option files](../../configuring-mariadb/configuring-mariadb-with-option-files.md):

| Option | Reason |
| ------ | ------ |
|        |        |

#### Authentication and TLS

* See [Authentication from MariaDB 10.4](../../../../security/user-account-management/authentication-from-mariadb-10-4.md) for an overview of the changes.
* The [unix\_socket authentication plugin](../../../../reference/plugins/authentication-plugins/authentication-plugin-unix-socket.md) is now default on Unix-like systems.
* TLSv1.0 is disabled by default in [MariaDB 10.4](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/what-is-mariadb-104). See [tls\_version](../../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/ssltls-system-variables.md#tls_version) and [TLS Protocol Versions](../../../../security/securing-mariadb/securing-mariadb-encryption/data-in-transit-encryption/secure-connections-overview.md#tls-protocol-versions).
