# LAST\_VALUE

## Syntax

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expr,[expr,...])
```

```sql
LAST_VALUE(expr) OVER (
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression ]
  [ ORDER BY order_list ]
)
```

## Description

`LAST_VALUE()` evaluates all expressions and returns the last. This is useful together with [setting user variables to a value with @var:=expr](../../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md), for example when you want to get data of rows updated/deleted without having to do two queries against the table.

`LAST_VALUE` can be used as a [window function](../../special-functions/window-functions/).

Returns `NULL` if no last value exists.

## Examples

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (a int, b int);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,10),(2,20);
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a=1 AND last_value(@a:=a,@b:=b,1);
SELECT @a,@b;
+------+------+
| @a   | @b   |
+------+------+
|    1 |   10 |
+------+------+
```

As a [window function](../../special-functions/window-functions/):

```sql
CREATE TABLE t1 (
  pk int primary key,
  a int,
  b int,
  c char(10),
  d decimal(10, 3),
  e real
);

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES
( 1, 0, 1,    'one',    0.1,  0.001),
( 2, 0, 2,    'two',    0.2,  0.002),
( 3, 0, 3,    'three',  0.3,  0.003),
( 4, 1, 2,    'three',  0.4,  0.004),
( 5, 1, 1,    'two',    0.5,  0.005),
( 6, 1, 1,    'one',    0.6,  0.006),
( 7, 2, NULL, 'n_one',  0.5,  0.007),
( 8, 2, 1,    'n_two',  NULL, 0.008),
( 9, 2, 2,    NULL,     0.7,  0.009),
(10, 2, 0,    'n_four', 0.8,  0.010),
(11, 2, 10,   NULL,     0.9,  NULL);

SELECT pk, FIRST_VALUE(pk) OVER (ORDER BY pk) AS first_asc,
           LAST_VALUE(pk) OVER (ORDER BY pk) AS last_asc,
           FIRST_VALUE(pk) OVER (ORDER BY pk DESC) AS first_desc,
