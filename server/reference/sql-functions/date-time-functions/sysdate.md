# SYSDATE

## Syntax

```sql
SYSDATE([precision])
```

## Description

Returns the current date and time as a value in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` or `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.uuuuuu` format, depending on whether the function is used in a string or numeric context.

The optional _precision_ determines the microsecond precision. See [Microseconds in MariaDB](microseconds-in-mariadb.md).

`SYSDATE()` returns the time at which it executes. This differs from the behavior for [NOW()](now.md), which returns a constant time that indicates the time at which the statement began to execute. (Within a stored routine or trigger, NOW() returns the time at which the routine or triggering statement began to execute.)

In addition, changing the [timestamp system variable](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#timestamp) with a [SET](../../sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/set-commands/set.md) `timestamp` statement affects the value returned by `NOW()` but not by `SYSDATE()`. This means that timestamp settings in the [binary log](../../../server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log/) have no effect on invocations of `SYSDATE()`.

Because `SYSDATE()` can return different values even within the same statement, and is not affected by `SET TIMESTAMP`, it is non-deterministic and therefore unsafe for replication if statement-based binary logging is used. If that is a problem, you can use row-based logging, or start the server with the [--sysdate-is-now](../../../server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd-options.md#-sysdate-is-now) mariadbd option to cause `SYSDATE()` to be an alias for `NOW()`. The non-deterministic nature of `SYSDATE()` also means that indexes cannot be used for evaluating expressions that refer to it, and that statements using the `SYSDATE()` function are [unsafe for statement-based replication](../../../ha-and-performance/standard-replication/unsafe-statements-for-statement-based-replication.md).

## Examples

Difference between `NOW()` and `SYSDATE()`:

```sql
SELECT NOW(), SLEEP(2), NOW();
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| NOW()               | SLEEP(2) | NOW()               |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| 2010-03-27 13:23:40 |        0 | 2010-03-27 13:23:40 |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+

SELECT SYSDATE(), SLEEP(2), SYSDATE();
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| SYSDATE()           | SLEEP(2) | SYSDATE()           |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
| 2010-03-27 13:23:52 |        0 | 2010-03-27 13:23:54 |
+---------------------+----------+---------------------+
```

With precision:

```sql
SELECT SYSDATE(4);
+--------------------------+
| SYSDATE(4)               |
+--------------------------+
| 2018-07-10 10:17:13.1689 |
+--------------------------+
```
