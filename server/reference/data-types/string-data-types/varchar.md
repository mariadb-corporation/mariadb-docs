# VARCHAR

## Syntax

```sql
[NATIONAL] VARCHAR(M) [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
```

## Description

A variable-length string. M represents the maximum column length in characters. The range of M is 0 to 65,532. The effective maximum length of a `VARCHAR` is subject to the maximum row size and the character set used. For example, utf8 characters can require up to three bytes per character, so a `VARCHAR` column that uses the utf8 character set can be declared to be a maximum of 21,844 characters.

#### Note:

For the [ColumnStore](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/columnstore) engine, M represents the maximum column length in bytes.

MariaDB stores `VARCHAR` values as a one-byte or two-byte length prefix plus data. The length prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. A `VARCHAR` column uses one length byte if values require no more than 255 bytes, two length bytes if values may require more than 255 bytes.

MariaDB follows the standard SQL specification, and does not remove trailing spaces from `VARCHAR` values.

`VARCHAR(0)` columns can contain 2 values: an empty string or `NULL`. Such columns cannot be part of an index. The [CONNECT](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/connect/) storage engine does not support `VARCHAR(0)`.

VARCHAR is shorthand for `CHARACTER VARYING`. `NATIONAL VARCHAR` is the standard SQL way to define that a `VARCHAR` column should use some predefined character set. MariaDB uses utf8 as this\
predefined character set, as does MySQL. `NVARCHAR` is shorthand for `NATIONAL VARCHAR`.

For MariaDB, a number of [NO PAD collations](character-sets/supported-character-sets-and-collations.md#no-pad-collations) are available.

If a unique index consists of a column where trailing pad characters are stripped or ignored, inserts into that column where values differ only by the number of trailing pad characters will result in a duplicate-key error.

### SYNONYMS

The following are synonyms for `VARCHAR`:

* CHAR VARYING
* CHARACTER VARYING
* VARCHAR2
* VARCHARACTER

## Examples

The following are equivalent:

```sql
VARCHAR(30) CHARACTER SET utf8
NATIONAL VARCHAR(30)
NVARCHAR(30)
NCHAR VARCHAR(30)
NATIONAL CHARACTER VARYING(30)
NATIONAL CHAR VARYING(30)
```

### Trailing spaces

```sql
CREATE TABLE strtest (v VARCHAR(10));
INSERT INTO strtest VALUES('Maria   ');

SELECT v='Maria',v='Maria   ' FROM strtest;
+-----------+--------------+
| v='Maria' | v='Maria   ' |
+-----------+--------------+
|         1 |            1 |
+-----------+--------------+

SELECT v LIKE 'Maria',v LIKE 'Maria   ' FROM strtest;
+----------------+-------------------+
| v LIKE 'Maria' | v LIKE 'Maria   ' |
+----------------+-------------------+
|              0 |                 1 |
+----------------+-------------------+
```

### VARCHAR

For our example of `VARCHAR`, we picked a maximum size that avoids overflowing the maximum row size (65535). Keep in mind that a multi-byte character set would need more space in the row than a single-byte character set. We also avoid the auto-conversion of a `VARCHAR` into a `TEXT`, `MEDIUMTEXT`, or `LONGTEXT` that can happen when `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` is not set in the `SQL_MODE`.

The example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE varchar_example (
   description VARCHAR(20),
   example VARCHAR(65511)
) DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1; -- One byte per char makes the examples clearer
```

```sql
INSERT INTO varchar_example VALUES
   ('Normal foo', 'foo'),
   ('Trailing spaces foo', 'foo      '),
   ('NULLed', NULL),
   ('Empty', ''),
   ('Maximum', RPAD('', 65511, 'x'));
```

```sql
SELECT description, LENGTH(example) AS length
   FROM varchar_example;
```

```sql
+---------------------+--------+
| description         | length |
+---------------------+--------+
| Normal foo          |      3 |
| Trailing spaces foo |      9 |
| NULLed              |   NULL |
| Empty               |      0 |
| Maximum             |  65511 |
+---------------------+--------+
```

### Data too Long

When `SQL_MODE` is strict (the default) a value is considered "too long" when its length exceeds the size of the data type, and an error is generated.

Example of data too long behavior for `VARCHAR`:

```sql
TRUNCATE varchar_example;

INSERT INTO varchar_example VALUES
   ('Overflow', RPAD('', 65512, 'x'));
```

```sql
ERROR 1406 (22001): Data too long for column 'example' at row 1
```

## Truncation

* Depending on whether or not [strict sql mode](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md#strict-mode) is set, you will either get a warning or an error if you try to insert a string that is too long into a `VARCHAR` column. If the extra characters are spaces, the spaces that can't fit will be removed and you will always get a warning, regardless of the [sql mode](../../../server-management/variables-and-modes/sql-mode.md) setting.

## Difference Between VARCHAR and TEXT

* `VARCHAR` columns can be fully indexed. [TEXT](text.md) columns can only be indexed over a specified length.
* Using [TEXT](text.md) or [BLOB](blob.md) in a [SELECT](../../sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/select.md) query that uses temporary tables for storing intermediate results will force the temporary table to be disk based (using the [Aria storage engine](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-storage-engine.md) instead of the [memory storage engine](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/memory-storage-engine.md), which is a bit slower. This is not that bad as the [Aria storage engine](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-storage-engine.md) caches the rows in memory. To get the benefit of this, one should ensure that the [aria\_pagecache\_buffer\_size](../../../server-usage/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables.md#aria_pagecache_buffer_size) variable is big enough to hold most of the row and index data for temporary tables.

## Oracle Mode

In [Oracle mode](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/about/compatibility-and-differences/sql_modeoracle), `VARCHAR2` is a synonym.

### For Storage Engine Developers

* Internally, the full length of the `VARCHAR` column is allocated inside each `TABLE` objects record\[] structure. As there are three such buffers, each open table will allocate 3 times max-length-to-store-varchar bytes of memory.
* [TEXT](text.md) and [BLOB](blob.md) columns are stored with a pointer (4 or 8 bytes) + a 1-4 bytes length. The [TEXT](text.md) data is only stored once. This means that internally `TEXT` uses less memory for each open table but instead has the additional overhead that each `TEXT` object needs to be allocated and freed for each row access (with some caching in between).
