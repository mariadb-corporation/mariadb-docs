# Configuring PAM Authentication and User Mapping with Unix Authentication

We walk through the configuration of PAM authentication using the [pam](authentication-plugin-pam.md) authentication plugin and user and group mapping with the [pam\_user\_map](user-and-group-mapping-with-pam.md) PAM module. The primary authentication will be handled by the [pam\_unix](https://linux.die.net/man/8/pam_unix) PAM module, which performs standard Unix password authentication.

## Hypothetical Requirements

In this walkthrough, we are going to assume the following hypothetical requirements:

* The Unix user `foo` should be mapped to the MariaDB user `bar`. (`foo: bar`)
* Any Unix user in the Unix group `dba` should be mapped to the MariaDB user `dba`. (`@dba: dba`)

## Creating Our Unix Users and Groups

Let's go ahead and create the Unix users and groups that we are using for this hypothetical scenario.

First, let's create the `foo` user and a couple users to go into the `dba` group. Note that each of these users needs a password.

```bash
sudo useradd foo
sudo passwd foo
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice
sudo useradd bob
sudo passwd bob
```

Next, let's create the `dba` group and add our two users to it:

```bash
sudo groupadd dba
sudo usermod -a -G dba alice 
sudo usermod -a -G dba bob
```

We also need to create Unix users with the same name as the `bar` and `dba` MariaDB users. See [here](user-and-group-mapping-with-pam.md#pam-user-with-same-name-as-mapped-mariadb-user-must-exist) to read more about why. No one will be logging in as these users, so they do not need passwords.

```bash
sudo useradd bar
sudo useradd dba -g dba
```

## Installing the pam\_user\_map PAM Module

Next, let's [install the pam\_user\_map PAM module](user-and-group-mapping-with-pam.md#installing-the-pam_user_map-pam-module).

Before the module can be compiled from source, we may need to install some dependencies.

On RHEL, CentOS, and other similar Linux distributions that use [RPM packages](../../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages/rpm/), we need to install `gcc` and `pam-devel`:

```bash
sudo yum install gcc pam-devel
```

On Debian, Ubuntu, and other similar Linux distributions that use [DEB packages](../../../../server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages/installing-mariadb-deb-files.md), we need to install `gcc` and `libpam0g-dev`:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc libpam0g-dev
```

And then we can build and install the library with the following:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MariaDB/server/10.4/plugin/auth_pam/mapper/pam_user_map.c 
gcc pam_user_map.c -shared -lpam -fPIC -o pam_user_map.so 
sudo install --mode=0755 pam_user_map.so /lib64/security/
```

## Configuring the pam\_user\_map PAM Module

Next, let's [configure the pam\_user\_map PAM module](user-and-group-mapping-with-pam.md#configuring-the-pam_user_map-pam-module) based on our hypothetical requirements.

The configuration file for the `pam_user_map` PAM module is `/etc/security/user_map.conf`. Based on our hypothetical requirements, ours would look like:

```
foo: bar
@dba:dba
```

## Installing the PAM Authentication Plugin

Next, let's [install the pam authentication plugin](authentication-plugin-pam.md#installing-the-plugin).

Log into the MariaDB Server and execute the following:

```
INSTALL SONAME 'auth_pam';
```

## Configuring the PAM Service

Next, let's [configure the PAM service](authentication-plugin-pam.md#configuring-the-pam-service). We will call our service `mariadb`, so our PAM service configuration file will be located at `/etc/pam.d/mariadb` on most systems.

Since we are only doing Unix authentication with the `pam_unix` PAM module and group mapping with the `pam_user_map` PAM module, our configuration file would look like this:

```ini
auth required pam_unix.so audit
auth required pam_user_map.so
account required pam_unix.so audit
```

## Configuring the pam\_unix PAM Module

The `pam_unix` PAM module adds [some additional configuration steps](authentication-plugin-pam.md#configuring-the-pam-service) on a lot of systems. We basically have to give the user that runs `mysqld` access to `/etc/shadow`.

If the `mysql` user is running `mysqld`, then we can do that by executing the following:

```bash
sudo groupadd shadow
sudo usermod -a -G shadow mysql
sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
sudo chmod g+r /etc/shadow
```

The server needs to be restarted for this change to take affect.

## Creating MariaDB Users

Next, let's [create the MariaDB users](authentication-plugin-pam.md#creating-users). Remember that our PAM service is called `mariadb`.

First, let's create the MariaDB user for the user mapping: `foo: bar` . This means we need to create a `bar` user:

```sql
CREATE USER 'bar'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'bar'@'%' ;
```

Next, let's create the MariaDB user for the group mapping: `@dba: dba` . This means that we need to create a `dba` user:

```sql
CREATE USER 'dba'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dba'@'%' ;
```

Next, to allow for the user and group mapping, we need to [create an anonymous user that authenticates with the pam authentication plugin](user-and-group-mapping-with-pam.md#creating-users) that is also able to `PROXY` as the `bar` and `dba` users. Before we can create the proxy user, we might need to [clean up some defaults](../../../sql-statements/account-management-sql-statements/create-user.md#fixing-a-legacy-default-anonymous-account):

```sql
DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE User='' AND Host='%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Finally, let's create the anonymous proxy user:

```sql
CREATE USER ''@'%' IDENTIFIED VIA pam USING 'mariadb';
GRANT PROXY ON 'bar'@'%' TO ''@'%';
GRANT PROXY ON 'dba'@'%' TO ''@'%';
```

## Testing our Configuration

Next, let's test out our configuration by [verifying that mapping is occurring](user-and-group-mapping-with-pam.md#verifying-that-mapping-is-occurring). We can verify this by logging in as each of our users and comparing the return value of [USER()](../../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/user.md), which is the original user name and the return value of [CURRENT\_USER()](../../../sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/current_user.md), which is the authenticated user name.

First, let's test our `foo` user:

```bash
$ mysql -u foo -h 172.30.0.198
[mariadb] Password:

```

We can verify that our `foo` Unix user was properly mapped to the `bar` MariaDB user by looking at the return value of `CURRENT_USER()`.

Next, let's test our `alice` user in the `dba` group:

```bash
$ mysql -u alice -h 172.30.0.198
[mariadb] Password:

+--------------------------------------------------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```

Finally, let's test our `bob` user in the `dba` group:

```bash
$ mysql -u bob -h 172.30.0.198
[mariadb] Password:
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

MariaDB [(none)]> SELECT USER(), CURRENT_USER();
+------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| USER()                                         | CURRENT_USER() |
+------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| bob@ip-172-30-0-198.us-west-2.compute.internal | dba@%          |
+------------------------------------------------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```

We can verify that our `alice` and `bob` Unix users in the `dba` Unix group were properly mapped to the `dba` MariaDB user by looking at the return values of `CURRENT_USER()`.
