# io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_latency and x$io\_global\_by\_wait\_by\_latency Sys Schema Views

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/sys-schema-views-are-availa....md" %}

## Description

The `io_global_by_wait_by_latency` and `x$io_global_by_wait_by_latency` views summarize global I/O consumers, displaying I/O and time waiting for I/O, grouped by event. Rows are sorted by descending total latency by default.

The `io_global_by_wait_by_latency` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$io_global_by_wait_by_latency` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| event\_name      | I/O event name. The wait/io/file prefix is stripped.            |
| total            | Total number of occurrences of the I/O event.                   |
| total\_latency   | Total wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event.          |
| min\_latency     | Minimum single wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event. |
| avg\_latency     | Average wait time per timed occurrence of the I/O event.        |
| max\_latency     | Maximum single wait time of timed occurrences of the I/O event. |
| count\_read      | Total number of read request for the I/O event.                 |
| total\_read      | Total number of bytes read for the I/O event.                   |
| avg\_read        | Average number of bytes per read for the I/O event.             |
| count\_write     | Total number of write requests for the I/O event.               |
| total\_written   | Number of bytes written for the I/O event.                      |
| avg\_written     | Average number of bytes per write for the I/O event.            |
| total\_requested | Total number of bytes (read and write) for the I/O event.       |
