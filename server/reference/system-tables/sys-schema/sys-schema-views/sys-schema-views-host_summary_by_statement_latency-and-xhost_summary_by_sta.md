# host\_summary\_by\_statement\_latency and x$host\_summary\_by\_statement\_latency Sys Schema Views

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/sys-schema-views-are-availa....md" %}

## Description

The `host_summary_by_statement_latency` and `x$host_summary_by_statement_latency` views summarize statement statistics, grouped by host. Rows are sorted by descending total latency by default. The `host_summary_by_statement_latency` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$host_summary_by_statement_latency` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:

| Column         | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host           | Host that the client connected from, or background for background threads (where the HOST column in the underlying Performance Schema table is NULL). |
| total          | Total number of statements for the host.                                                                                                              |
| max\_latency   | Maximum single wait time of timed statements for the host.                                                                                            |
| lock\_latency  | Total time spent by timed statements for the host waiting for locks.                                                                                  |
| total\_latency | Total wait time of timed statements for the host.                                                                                                     |
| rows\_sent     | Total number of rows returned by statements for the host.                                                                                             |
| rows\_examined | Total number of rows read from storage engines by statements for the host.                                                                            |
| rows\_affected | Total number of rows affected by statements for the host.                                                                                             |
| full\_scans    | Total number of full table scans by statements for the host.                                                                                          |
