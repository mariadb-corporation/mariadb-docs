# OK\_Packet

`OK_Packet` is sent by the server to the client and indicates a successful completion of a command sent by the client before.

## Direction

Server to client.

## Fields

* [int<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) 0x00 : `OK_Packet` header or (`0xFE` if `CLIENT_DEPRECATE_EOF` is set).
* [int](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-integers) affected rows.
* [int](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-integers) last insert id.
* [int<2>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) [server status](ok_packet.md#server-status-flag).
* [int<2>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) warning count.
* If packet has more data:
  * [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) info.
  * If (status flags & `SERVER_SESSION_STATE_CHANGED`) and `session_tracking_supported` (see [CLIENT\_SESSION\_TRACK](../1-connecting/connection.md)):
    * [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) [session state info](ok_packet.md#session-state-info).

The length-encoded info string is not always included in the packet. Check the length of the packet to detect if there is data after the warning count. For the first `OK_Packet` in the connection it contains (if present) the [SSL certificate verification signature](https://mariadb.org/mission-impossible-zero-configuration-ssl/). For the following `OK_Packets` it contains (if present) various human-readable information.

## Server status flag

## Session state info

* While packet has remaining data:
  * [int<1>](../protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) [session change type](ok_packet.md#session-change-type).
  * If (session-change-type != `SESSION_TRACK_STATE_CHANGE`):
    * [int](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-integers) total length.
  * [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) session data change.

## Session change type

| Change Type | Flag                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0           | SESSION\_TRACK\_SYSTEM\_VARIABLES            |

### Session Data Change

Each type of data has its own kind of format:

#### **SESSION\_TRACK\_SCHEMA**

* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) new current schema.

#### **SESSION\_TRACK\_SYSTEM\_VARIABLES**

While there is remaining data:

* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) variable data.

For each variable data:

* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) variable name.
* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) variable value.

{% hint style="info" %}
Possible tracked variables list is tracked by [session\_track\_system\_variables](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md) special variable value description:

* [redirect\_url](../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#redirect_url): format is `mariadb/mysql:[<user>[:<password>]@]<host>[:<port>]/[<db>[?<opt1>=<value1>[&<opt2>=<value2>]]]`. Possible options:
  * `ttl` : cache timeout in ms to remember redirection, in order to reconnect directly to new host. 0=no caching
{% endhint %}

#### **SESSION\_TRACK\_STATE\_CHANGE**

Indicates if session state changes occurred. The value is represented as `1`.

* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) `1` if session state tracking was enabled.

#### **SESSION\_TRACK\_GTIDS**

This tracker is not implemented by MariaDB.

#### **SESSION\_TRACK\_TRANSACTION\_CHARACTERISTICS**

* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) Transaction characteristics.

Transaction characteristics is the set of SQL statements that reproduce the type and state of the current transaction. It can consist of the following SQL statements:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
START TRANSACTION;
START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT;
START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT, READ ONLY;
START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT, READ WRITE;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
XA START <XA specification>;
```

#### **SESSION\_TRACK\_TRANSACTION\_STATE**

* [string](../protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings) Transaction state string.

The transaction state string is always 8 characters long. The characters, in order, are:

1. No transaction: `_` Explicit transaction: `T` Implicit transaction: `I`
2. Transaction read safe: `_` Transaction read unsafe: `r`
3. Unknown transaction type: `_` Read-only transaction: `R`
4. Transaction write safe: `_` Transaction write unsafe: `w`
5. Unknown transaction type: `_` Read-write transaction: `W`
6. Transaction statement safe: `_` Transaction statement unsafe: `s`
7. Transaction does not have resultsets: `_` Transaction with result sets: `S`
8. No locked tables: `_` Tables have been locked: `L`

## Notes

* To determine if session tracking is enabled, check if the [CLIENT\_SESSION\_TRACK](../1-connecting/connection.md) flag is set in `server_capabilities`.
