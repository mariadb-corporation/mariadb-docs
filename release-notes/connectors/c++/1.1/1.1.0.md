## Notable Changes

* The default connection character set is `utf8mb4`. ([CONCPP-91](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-91))
* Re-execution or destruction on any type of statement object closes all of its result-sets. ([CONCPP-88](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-88))
* `ResultSet` streaming is supported. The `defaultFetchSize` connection option sets the default number of rows in a result-sets retrieved at a time. The `setFetchSize` statement method sets number of rows for the statement. ([CONCPP-72](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-72))

## Notable API Changes

* `ResultSet` get methods are `const` ([CONCPP-86](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-86))
* `sql::Properties` class passed to connect methods is a class defined in the library. `DatabaseMetaData::getTables` accepts the `sql::List` class object. Methods still accept `std::map` and `std::list` objects. ([CONCPP-83](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-83))
* `SQLString` class supports `find` methods. ([CONCPP-90](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-90))
* `Properties` parameters to connect methods are `const` ([CONCPP-82](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-82))
* `SQLString` constructor from `std::string` is not exported on Windows. ([CONCPP-85](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONCPP-85))
