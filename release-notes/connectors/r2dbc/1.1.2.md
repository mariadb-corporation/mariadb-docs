# Connector/R2DBC 1.1.2 Release Notes

## Overview

MariaDB Connector/R2DBC is a non-blocking interface between Java applications and MariaDB Server. MariaDB Connector/R2DBC enables the development of Java 8+ applications for MariaDB database products.

**Release date:** 27 Jun 2022

MariaDB Connector/R2DBC 1.1.2 is a [_**Stable**_](../../../community-server/about/release-criteria.md) _**(GA)**_ release.

This release implements the [R2DBC 0.9.1.](https://r2dbc.io/spec/0.9.1.RELEASE/spec/html/) specifications.

## Notable Changes

* R2DBC Specification Compliance (0.9.1): Support for the R2DBC spec 0.9.1 version has been added to ensure alignment with the latest specification. ([R2DBC-54](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-54))
* SPI TestKit Integration: A standard SPI TestKit has been implemented to validate the driver against R2DBC specification tests, ensuring conformance and improving reliability across spec versions. ([R2DBC-45](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-45))
* Failover and Load Balancing Support : The connector now supports failover and load balancing modes, improving high-availability deployments. ([R2DBC-49](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-49))
* Backpressure Handling: Proper backpressure handling has been implemented, aligning the connector with reactive stream semantics and preventing consumer overload under high throughput. ([R2DBC-63](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-63))
* Batch Cancellation Support: Batch operations can now be cancelled mid-execution, giving applications finer control over long-running batch workloads. ([R2DBC-64](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-64))
* SQL Information Added to Exception Hierarchy: Exceptions in the R2DBC exception hierarchy now carry the originating SQL statement, making error diagnostics significantly easier. ([R2DBC-46](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-46))
* Simplified Client-Side Prepared Statements: The client-side prepared statement implementation has been simplified, reducing complexity and improving maintainability. ([R2DBC-44](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-44))
* Statement::add Specification Precision: The behavior of Statement::add has been aligned with the R2DBC specification, clarifying semantics around adding bindings to batch statements. ([R2DBC-42](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-42))
* Transaction Isolation Spec Alignment: Transaction isolation level handling has been updated to precisely match the R2DBC specification. ([R2DBC-56](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-56))
* TIME Data Type Default Return Type Changed: TIME columns without an explicit type indication now return Duration instead of LocalTime, aligning with the R2DBC specification's intent for time-without-timezone values. ([R2DBC-50](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-50))
* VARBINARY Default Return Type: VARBINARY data now correctly defaults to returning byte[], matching expected binary data handling behavior per the spec. ([R2DBC-57](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-57))

## Issues Fixed

* Row.get Error Handling: The driver now correctly returns an error when Row.get is called with an invalid column reference, matching the behavior mandated by the R2DBC specification. ([R2DBC-47](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-47))
* Trailing Batch Statement Now Fails as Expected: Following a spec clarification on batch semantics, a trailing (incomplete) batch statement now correctly raises an error rather than being silently ignored. ([R2DBC-48](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-48))
* RowMetadata Case-Sensitivity Lookup Corrected: Column name lookups via RowMetadata now correctly respect case-sensitivity rules as defined by the specification. ([R2DBC-53](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-53))
* Prepared Statement Column Type Resolution: When a prepared statement returns incorrect column type metadata during the prepare phase, this is no longer silently skipped—the connector now handles it correctly to avoid data type mismatches. ([R2DBC-62](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/R2DBC-62))
