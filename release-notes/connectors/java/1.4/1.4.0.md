This version is a bugfix / performance improvement release.

## Notable changes and additions

### Complete implementation of fetch size

[CONJ-26](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-26)\
JDBC allows specifying the number of rows fetched for a query, and this number is referred to as the fetch size.\
Before version 1.4.0, queries were loading all results or row by row using `Statement.setFetchSize(Integer.MIN_VALUE)`.\
Now it's possible to set the fetch size according to your needs.\
Loading all results for large result sets uses a lot of memory. This functionality permits saving memory without a performance decrease.

### Memory footprint improvement

[CONJ-125](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-125) - Buffers have been optimized to reduced memory footprint

### CallableStatement performance improvement

[CONJ-209](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-209) - Calling function / procedure performance is now optimized according to the query. Depending on the queries, the difference can be up to 300%.

### Authentication evolution

[CONJ-251](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-251) Permit new authentication possibilities : [PAM authentication](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/plugins/authentication-plugins/authentication-with-pluggable-authentication-modules-pam/authentication-plugin-pam), and GSSAPI/SSPI authentication.

The GSSAPI/SSPI authentication plugin for MariaDB permits passwordless login.

On Unix systems, GSSAPI is usually synonymous with Kerberos authentication. Windows has a slightly different but very similar API called SSPI that, along with Kerberos, also supports NTLM authentication.

See more details at: [GSSAPI/SSPI configuration](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-connector-j/blob/master/documentation/plugin/GSSAPI.creole)

### Connection attributes

[CONJ-217](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-217) - Driver information is now sent to [connection attributes tables](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-session_connect_attrs-table) (performance\_schema must be activated).\
A new option "connectionAttributes" permits adding client-specific data.

For example when connecting with the following connection string `"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testj?user=root&connectionAttributes=myOption:1,mySecondOption:'jj'"`,\
if performance\_schema is activated, information about this connection will be available during the time this connection is active :

```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_schema.session_connect_attrs WHERE processList_id = 5
```

```

### Minor evolution

* [CONJ-210](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-210) : adding a "jdbcCompliantTruncation" option to force truncation warning as an SQLException.
* [CONJ-211](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-211) : when in master/slave configuration, option "assureReadOnly" will ensure that slaves are in read-only mode ( forcing transaction by a query "SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY").
* [CONJ-213](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-213) : new option "continueBatchOnError". Permit to continue batch when an exception occur : When executing a batch and an error occur, must the batch stop immediatly (default) or finish remaining batch before throwing exception.

### Bugfix

* [CONJ-236](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-236) : Using a parametrized query with a smallint -1 does return the unsigned value
* [CONJ-250](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-250) : Tomcat doesn't stop when using Aurora failover configuration
* [CONJ-269](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-269) : handle server configuration autocommit=0
* [CONJ-271](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-271) : ResultSet.first() may throw SQLDataException: Current position is before the first row
