## Notable Changes

### Batch Bulk behavior

[CONJ-920](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-920)

Bulk batching enabled by default (option `useBulkStmts`) with permit super fast batching, but batch return array of update counts with Statement.SUCCESS\_NO\_INFO values.\
The problem is that application using optimistic locking fails, expecting exact return value.

`useBulkStmts` is now defaulting to false, with the addition of a new option `useBulkStmtsForInserts`, enabled by default permit to enable bulk for insert command only. This permit to have return values in batching return value, for all cases, permitting optimistic behavior.

This default values are more appropriate for all kind of application. If application doesn't use optimistic locking, enabling `useBulkStmts` is then more appropriate, because UPDATE and DELETE commands in batch will then use faster BULK implementation.

### Maxscale improvement

[CONJ-1084](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-1084)

When using maxscale 23.08.0+, when a maxscale node fails, connector will now priorize reconnection to the maxscales nodes having less connections, to ensure connections repartition after failover.\
This allows a faster return to normal
