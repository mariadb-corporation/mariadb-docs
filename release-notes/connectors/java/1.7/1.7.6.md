## Bugs Fixed

* [CONJ-522](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-522) : When using multiple pools and a pool is closed, it closes a global executor used by all pools. This occurs even if there are still other pools open.

* [CONJ-639](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONJ-639) : enabledSslProtocolSuites does not include TLSv1.2 by default
