# MySQL-wsrep 8.4.7-26.25 Release Notes

## Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.4.7-26.25 (2025-11-19)

Codership is pleased to announce the first LTS release of Galera Cluster for MySQL 8.4, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.4.7 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.4.7.

Galera Cluster 8.4 is available as targeted packages and package repositories for Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from [https://www.galeracluster.com](https://www.galeracluster.com/) or [https://www.mariadb.com/](https://www.mariadb.com/) (as Codership has been acquired by MariaDB plc).

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep.

### Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep in 8.4.7-26.25:

* Galera SST method mysqldump does not anymore disallow all writes during SST.

### Known Issues:

* InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they may not be copied over during SST.
