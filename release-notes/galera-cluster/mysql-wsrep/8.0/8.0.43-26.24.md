# MySQL-wsrep 8.0.43-26.24 Release Notes

## Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.43-26.24 (2025-09-08)

Codership is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL 8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.42 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.43.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories for Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from [https://www.galeracluster.com](https://www.galeracluster.com/) or [https://www.mariadb.com/](https://www.mariadb.com/) (as Codership has been acquired by MariaDB plc).

The source repositories and bug tracking are now on [https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep](https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep)

### Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.42-26.23:

* Diagnostics\_area does not always contain apply error info causing inconsistency voting to work incorrectly. To account for this, first try to obtain error info from Diagnostics\_area, then fallback to Relay\_log\_info. If that fails, use some"random" data to distinguish this condition from success.
* Change wsrep\_sst\_mysqldump script to provide output for MariaDB to provide means to migrate from MySQL 8.0 Galera cluster to MariaDB 11.4 Galera cluster.
* MySQL server crashed if an empty transaction accessed foreign key child table and was implicitly committed by CREATE TABLE.

### Known Issues:

* InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they may not be copied over during SST.
