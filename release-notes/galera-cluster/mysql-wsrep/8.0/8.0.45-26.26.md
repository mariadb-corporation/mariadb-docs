# MySQL-wsrep 8.0.45-26.26 Release Notes

## Changes in MySQL-wsrep 8.0.45-26.26 (2026-02-18)

MariaDB is pleased to announce a new GA release of Galera Cluster for MySQL 8.0, consisting of MySQL-wsrep 8.0.45 and wsrep API version 26.

This release incorporates all changes up to MySQL 8.0.45.

Galera Cluster 8.0 is available as targeted packages and package repositories for Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from [https://mariadb.com/galera-downloads/](https://mariadb.com/galera-downloads/)

### Notable changes and fixes in MySQL-wsrep since the latest release 8.0.44-26.25:

* Configuration variable wsrep\_slave\_fk\_checks is deprecated and setting has no effect. Setting wsrep\_slave\_fk\_checks=OFF will easily result in inconsistency in any setup where there are cascading relations.
* Applier will now ignore binlog events it does not recognize

### Known Issues:

* InnoDB tablespaces outside of the data directory are not supported, as they may not be copied over during SST.
