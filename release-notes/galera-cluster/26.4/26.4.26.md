# Galera 26.4.26 Release Notes

## Changes in Galera 4.26 (2026-02-16)

MariaDB is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.26, implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a number of Linux distributions, including Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from [https://mariadb.com/galera-downloads/](https://mariadb.com/galera-downloads/)

### Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.25:

* Fixed error handling on posix\_fallocate in case it returns EOPNOTSUPP
* Fixed garb service startup to make sure the network is actually up at the moment of the garb service startup
* Fixed evs.auto\_evict parameter type to be integer as inteded
* Made galera library install destinations configurable
* Fixed error handling of thread priority setting in gcomm. Now a failure prints a log message instead of throwing an exception.
* Fixed some medium priority coverity issues
* Fixed race condition between an applier thread that sends JOIN after SST is complete and the GCS recv thread that switches Galera states and also can send JOIN message in case of a configuration change prevented the applier thread to do so.

### Known Issues:

* In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
