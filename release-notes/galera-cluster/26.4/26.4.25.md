# Galera 26.4.25 Release Notes

## Changes in Galera 4.25 (2025-11-19)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.25, implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a number of Linux distributions, including Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from [https://www.galeracluster.com](https://www.galeracluster.com/) or [https://www.mariadb.com](https://www.mariadb.com/) (as Codership has been acquired by MariaDB plc).

* Fixed issue where wrong variable name in the configuration leads Galera to think SST/IST failed, at next restart will request a full SST
* Fixed issue where old last\_applied value is inherited into new history

### Known Issues:

* In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
