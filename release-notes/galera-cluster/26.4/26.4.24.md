# Galera 26.4.24 Release Notes

## Changes in Galera 4.24 (2025-09-08)

Codership is pleased to announce the release of Galera Replication library 4.24, implementing wsrep API version 26.

The library is available as targeted packages and package repositories for a number of Linux distributions, including Debian 11 (Bullseye), and 12 (Bookworm), 22.04 LTS (Jammy), and 24.04 LTS (Noble), RHEL 8, and 9. Obtaining packages using a package repository removes the need to download individual files and facilitates the deployment and upgrade of Galera nodes.

This and future releases will be available from [https://www.galeracluster.com](https://www.galeracluster.com/) or [https://www.mariadb.com](https://www.mariadb.com/) (as Codership has been acquired by MariaDB plc).

### Notable changes and fixes in Galera since latest release 4.24:

* Added option to disable application level protocol check to allow migration from MySQL to MariaDB
* Fixed utility scripts to support MariaDB in addition to MySQL
* Fixed assertion failure when starting the cluster with `galera_new_cluster`
* Update wsrep API and implement config service v2. This implements version 2 of the config service. Version 2 of the service maintains the same interface and functionality of version 1. The difference is that version 2 is able to retrieve the complete list of parameters right after the Galera library is loaded, before initializing the replicator.

### Known Issues:

* In order to install Galera package on RHEL 8, MySQL and MariaDB modules need to be disabled first with `dnf -y module disable mysql mariadb`.
