  currently at version 25.3.9.
* Starting this version, [wsrep\_osu\_method](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables#wsrep_osu_method) has been made a session variable ([Issue#90](https://github.com/codership/mysql-wsrep/issues/90)).

### New and Deprecated Distributions

As per the [MariaDB Deprecation Policy](../../../about/platform-deprecation-policy.md), this will\
be the final release of MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.0 for Fedora 19 "Schr√∂dinger's Cat", Ubuntu\
10.04 LTS "Lucid", and Mint 9 LTS "Isadora". When the next\
version of MariaDB Galera Cluster 10.0 is released, repositories for these distributions will\
go away.

We have also added a couple of new Linux distributions with this release. Both\
Fedora 21 and Ubuntu 15.04 "Vivid" repositories are now available. As this is\
the first release with these repositories, they are considered experimental.\
Please [let us know](https://mariadb.org/jira) if you run into any issues with\
them.

## Notes

* Running MariaDB Galera Cluster 5.5 and 10.0 nodes in a cluster is not\
  supported ([MDEV-6257](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-6257))
* This version of MariaDB Galera Cluster supports `wsrep` API v25 which means\
  MariaDB Galera Cluster can be used with either a 25.2.x or 25.3.x\
  Galera `wsrep` provider. A 25.3.x `wsrep` provider is included in the\
  MariaDB repositories and is also available from the [downloads](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb-galera/5.5.42) page.
* See the [MariaDB 10.0.19 Release Notes](../../release-notes-mariadb-10-0-series/mariadb-10019-release-notes.md) and [Changelog](../../../changelogs/changelogs-mariadb-100-series/mariadb-10019-changelog.md) for more information on the changes in\
  MariaDB.
* On Ubuntu and Debian, the Galera Arbitrator daemon (garbd) and the galera\
  library are in two separate packages. The packages are named galera-3\
  and galera-arbitrator-3. When installing MariaDB Galera Cluster on Ubuntu and\
  Debian (the mariadb-galera-server package), the galera-3 package will be\
  automatically installed. You can then install the arbitrator package on a\
  separate node (recommended) or on one of the nodes running\
  mariadb-galera-server (not recommended).

Note: If Galera 25.2.x and 25.3.x are both being used in the cluster, MariaDB\
with Galera 25.3.x must be started with [wsrep\_provider\_options='socket.checksum=1'](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/wsrep-variable-details/wsrep_provider_options#socketchecksum) in order to make it backward\
compatible with Galera v2. Galera wsrep providers other than 25.3.x or 25.2.x\
are not supported.

Thanks, and enjoy MariaDB Galera Cluster!
