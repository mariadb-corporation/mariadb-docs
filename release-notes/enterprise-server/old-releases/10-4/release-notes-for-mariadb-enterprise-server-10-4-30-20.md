## Notable Changes

* InnoDB's internal performance has been improved. ([MDEV-30567](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30567))
* The aria\_log\_dir\_path system variable is added as read-only. ([MDEV-30971](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30971))
  * The `--aria-log-dir-path` command-line option is added to `mariadb-backup`.
* The default value for the core\_file system variable has been changed from None to OFF. ([MDEV-11356](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-11356))
* The innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable can no longer be changed dynamically. ([MDEV-30453](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30453))
  * In previous releases, when innodb\_buffer\_pool\_dump\_at\_shutdown was enabled, users with the SUPER privilege were able to dynamically change the value of the innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable: `SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_filename='SOME_FILE_PATH';`
  * Starting with this release, the innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable must be configured in a configuration file prior to starting up the server:

```
[mariadb]
innodb_buffer_pool_filename=SOME_FILE_PATH
```

## Issues Fixed

### Can result in data loss

* When a backup is created with `mariadb-backup` and `aria_log_dir_path` is configured, the Aria logs are not copied to the backup. ([MDEV-30968](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30968))
* When system versioning is enabled for a table without a primary key, changes to the table are not properly replicated. ([MDEV-30430](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30430))
* When a partitioned table contains a prefix index on a column that uses a NOPAD collation, queries with `ORDER BY` can return rows in the wrong order. ([MDEV-30072](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30072))
* For some collations, when a unique constraint is defined with `UNIQUE(..) USING HASH`, duplicate values are accepted. ([MDEV-30034](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30034))
* When an InnoDB table with `ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT` is being rebuilt due to a DDL statement, the server can crash while trying to apply cached DML operations to the rebuilt table. ([MDEV-26198](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26198))
* Long uniques don't work correctly with `Unicode` collations. Equal strings (in terms of the collation) are compared as unequal if the length of the strings are different. ([MDEV-27653](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27653), [MDEV-28190](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28190))
* When `innodb_buffer_pool_filename` is set to the empty string, the server tries to delete the datadir during shutdown. ([MDEV-30453](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30453))
* Starting with this release, the `innodb_buffer_pool_filename system variable` is read-only and can't be changed dynamically.
* When `slave_parallel_mode` is optimistic and `slave_parallel_threads` is greater than `0`, `ALTER SEQUENCE` can fail with an out-of-order binlog error if the sequence uses InnoDB. ([MDEV-31077](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31077))
  * In previous releases, the following error can be raised:`Last_Error: Error 'An attempt was made to binlog GTID 0-1-100 which would create an out-of-order sequence number with existing GTID 0-1-100 and gtid stric mode is enabled' on query. Default database: 'test'. Query: 'alter sequence s1 restart with 1' will be shown.`

### Can result in a hang or crash

* When an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` is rolled back from an InnoDB table with `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`, the server can crash. ([MDEV-30882](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30882))
* When the `LEFT()` function is called on a string that has no character set defined, the server can crash. ([MDEV-30351](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30351))
* With Galera, when `wsrep_sst_method=mariadb-backup` is set and `encrypt=4` is enabled for State Snapshot Transfers (SSTs), SSTs can fail if the version of socat installed on the donor node is 1.7.4.0 or later. ([MDEV-30402](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30402))
  * In previous releases, SSTs could fail with the following error in the donor node's MariaDB error log if the version of `socat` installed is 1.7.4.0 or later:`E Failed to set SNI host ""`
  * Starting with this release, when the SST script starts the socat listener on the donor node, the error is prevented by setting `no-sni=1` if the version of `socat` installed is 1.7.4.0 or later.
* When optimizer trace is enabled, if a view is part of a multi-table update, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31085](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31085))
* When a view definition contains a `UNION` and the view is queried using server-side prepared statements, if the optimizer pushes down a condition into the execution of the view, the server can crash during character set conversions. ([MDEV-31102](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31102))
* When a replica server connects to a primary server with `MASTER_USE_GTID=slave_pos`, if the primary server has encrypted binary logs that it can no longer decrypt, the primary server crashes due to a segmentation fault. ([MDEV-28798](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28798))
  * In previous releases, the primary node would iterate over all of its binary logs to look for the requested GTID. When one of the binary logs could not be decrypted, the server would crash.
  * Starting with this release, when the primary node fails to decrypt a binary log in this scenario, it stops iterating over the binary logs and raises an error with the `ER_MASTER_FATAL_ERROR_READING_BINLOG` error code with the following error message:`Got fatal error 1236 from master when reading data from binary log: 'Could not set up decryption for binlog.'`
* With Galera, when streaming replicating is enabled by setting the `wsrep_trx_fragment_size` system variable, the server can crash when certain fragment sizes are specified. ([MDEV-30838](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30838))
* When `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` is executed for a single-table DELETE that contains an IN(..) predicand, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31181](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31181))
* When parallel replication is enabled by setting `slave_parallel_threads` greater than 0, the replica's parallel replication worker threads could hang after hitting an error. ([MDEV-30780](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30780))
  * In previous releases, when the server was hung in this scenario, the output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` would show that an error occurred, but the output would indicate that both the I/O and SQL threads were running.`SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G`

```
*************************** 1. row ***************************

..
```

* In this scenario, this issue causes one of the parallel replication worker threads to hang in the `closing tables` state, so the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` would show one worker thread in that state indefinitely:`SHOW PROCESSLIST;<<code>>` +------+--------------+--------------------+------+--------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------+------------------+----------+

* When the optimizer chooses how to split a semi-join, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31403](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31403))
* With Galera, when `CREATE TEMPORARY SEQUENCE` is executed on a cluster node and binary logging is enabled, the server crashes. ([MDEV-25045](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25045))
* With Galera, when a write set fails certification and binary logging is enabled, the WSREP sequence numbers (cluster-wide transaction IDs) used by a WSREP applier thread can become out of sync with the node's XIDs (internal transaction IDs) due to a race condition, which can cause the node to crash. ([MDEV-27317](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27317))
* In previous releases, when a write set failed certification and binary logging was enabled, a WSREP applier thread could sync the WSREP sequence number out-of-order, because the commit order could be released too early.
* With Galera, when streaming replicating is enabled by setting the wsrep\_trx\_fragment\_size system variable and CREATE TABLE .. SELECT is executed, the server can crash. The following assertion is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash: ([MDEV-30862](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30862))

`Assertion` mode\_ == m\_high\_priority' failed in void wsrep::client\_state::after\_applying()\`

**Starting with this release, the server prohibits `CREATE TABLE .. SELECT` in this scenario and raises the `ER_NOT_ALLOWED_COMMAND` error code with the following error message:`ERROR 42000: CREATE TABLE AS SELECT is not supported with streaming replication`**

* With Galera, when a connection uses the handler interface to start a transaction on a table, the server can crash when the client disconnects. ([MDEV-30955](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30955))\
  In previous releases, when the client disconnected, the server would rollback the transaction and release all locks, including the locks that the handler interface expected to survive after the transaction ended, which would cause the server to crash.
  * In previous releases, the following assertion is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash:

```
void close_thread_table(THD*, TABLE**): Assertion `thd->mdl_context.is_lock_owner(MDL_key::TABLE, table->s->db.str, table->s->table_name.str, MDL_SHARED)' failed.
```

* With Galera, when an SST donor changes to the non-primary state, the SST is not terminated properly, and the donor node crashes. (MENT-1708)
  * In previous releases, the following error message and assertion is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash:

```
[Warning] WSREP: server: NODE_NAME unallowed state transition: connected -> joined
void wsrep::server_state::state(wsrep::unique_lock<wsrep::mutex>&, wsrep::server_state::state): Assertion `0' failed.
```

* When a query is executed that uses `DISTINCT` and an aggregate function on a group, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31113](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31113))
* When a server-side prepared statement is used to execute a query that references views and contains a `HAVING` clause, the server can crash upon second execution of the query. ([MDEV-31189](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31189))
* When the InnoDB purge thread tries to use the change buffer for an uncommitted index, the server aborts with an assertion. ([MDEV-30076](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30076))
* When the `rowid_filtering` optimization is used with a partitioned table, the server aborts with an assertion. ([MDEV-30596](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30596))
* With Galera, a hang can occur in "starting" commit state due a deadlock between a `KILL` command and an abort issued by an applier. (MENT-1855)
  * Starting with this release, Total Order Isolation (TOI) is not used for the KILL command.
* When `binlog_row_image=FULL` is set and `slave_parallel_threads` is greater than 0, replica servers can hang if data is inserted into tables with a sequence. ([MDEV-29621](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29621))
* InnoDB aborts when fulltext background thread does a sync commit operation. ([MDEV-24011](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-24011))

### Can result in unexpected behavior

When `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` is executed for a multi-table UPDATE that uses the system join type, the output can be incorrect. ([MDEV-31224](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31224))

When a query specifies `DISTINCT` and contains expressions using the SUM() function, the wrong results are returned. ([MDEV-20057](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20057))

* When a view's definition contains a `HAVING` clause, selecting from the view can fail with an error. ([MDEV-28570](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28570))
  * In previous releases, queries could raise an error with the `ER_VIEW_INVALID` error code and the following error message:`View 'test.v1' references invalid table(s) or column(s) or function(s) or definer/invoker of view lack rights to use them`
* When a view's definition contains an aggregate function, selecting from the view can fail with an error. ([MDEV-28571](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28571))
  * In previous releases, queries could raise an error with the `ER_INVALID_GROUP_FUNC_USE` error code and the following error message:\
    ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function
* When a view's definition contains a table-value constructor (TVC) as a single-value subquery, selecting from the view can fail with an error. ([MDEV-28603](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28603))
  * In previous releases, queries could raise an error with the `ER_VIEW_INVALID` error code and the following error message:`View 'test.v1' references invalid table(s) or column(s) or function(s) or definer/invoker of view lack rights to use them`

When a view's definition contains an aggregate function in an uncorrelated subquery, the wrong result is returned. ([MDEV-29224](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29224))

* When a `DELETE` statement contains a subquery with a HAVING clause or an aggregate function in the WHERE clause, the statement can fail with an error. ([MDEV-30586](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30586))
  * In previous releases, queries could raise an error with the `ER_INVALID_GROUP_FUNC_USE` error code and the following error message:`ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function`
* When an InnoDB tablespace has been discarded, selecting from `information_schema.INNODB_SYS_INDEXES` fails with an error. ([MDEV-30615](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30615))
  * In previous releases, an error with the `ER_UNKNOWN_ERROR` error code is raised:`ERROR 1105 (HY000): Unknown error`
  * Starting with this release, no error is returned, and the results contain `NULL` for the `PAGE_NO` and `SPACE` columns for discarded tablespaces.
* When `innodb_undo_directory` is set to a relative path, the path is not properly used by `mariadb-backup --copy-back`. ([MDEV-28187](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28187))
  * In previous releases, the undo logs would be copied to the relative path compared to the current working directory.
  * Starting with this release, the undo logs are copied to the relative path compared to the `datadir`.

When `UNIX_TIMESTAMP(CURRENT_TIME())` is executed, the incorrect value is returned. ([MDEV-26765](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26765))\
In previous releases, `NULL` is returned.

* With Galera, when `wsrep_sst_method='mariadb-backup'` is set, systemd raises an error about a mismatched PID. ([MDEV-25887](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25887))
  * In previous releases, systemd could raise the following error, where `BACKUP_PID` is the PID of MariaDB Enterprise Backup and SERVER\_PID is the PID of MariaDB Enterprise Server:`Got notification message from PID BACKUP_PID, but reception only permitted for main PID SERVER_PID`
* When an `UPDATE` contains a `WHERE` clause that contains a range condition over a non-indexed VARCHAR column, an error is raised. ([MDEV-20773](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20773))
  * In previous releases, an error with the `ER_DATA_TOO_LONG` error code is raised with the following error message:\
    ERROR 1406 (22001): Data too long for column 'COLUMN\_NAME' at row 1
* When `slave_parallel_threads` is greater than 0 and `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` is executed, the connection can try to acquire an uninitialized mutex. ([MDEV-30620](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30620))
  * In previous releases, a race condition could cause the mutexes of parallel replication worker threads to be acquired before they are initialized.
* The `ucs2_general_mysql500_ci` collation, which is intended for compatibility with older versions of MySQL, incorrectly sorts 'ß' after 's'. ([MDEV-30746](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30746))
* When `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` is executed with an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `REPLACE`, a warning containing the query text is not printed. ([MDEV-30539](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30539))
* The `rowid_filtering` optimization is applied incorrectly in some cases. ([MDEV-30218](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30218))
* When preparing a partial backup, MariaDB Enterprise Backup raises error messages about missing InnoDB tablespace files that are expected to be missing, because they were excluded from the backup. ([MDEV-29050](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29050))
* For certain data distributions, the optimizer histogram code can produce wrong selectivity, which can lead to performance degradation. ([MDEV-31067](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31067))
