# Release Notes for MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4.8-3

This third release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/README.md) 10.4 is a maintenance release, including a variety of fixes.

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.4.8-3 was released on 2019-09-30.

## Notable Changes

* [MariaDB Enterprise Audit](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/plugins/mariadb-audit-plugin) plugin sends error to the client when auditing could not be started. When reloaded, wrong filter definitions will result in an error and the old cache filters will be used. (MENT-256)

## Issues Fixed

### Can result in data loss

* Due to a race condition in InnoDB, an exclusive lock to an inserted record could be wrongly granted to multiple transactions when the [INSERT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insert) transaction commits. This could lead to a server crash or data loss. ([MDEV-15326](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-15326))
* INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, when there is more than one key, could result in inconsistent data between master and slave for replication mode [MIXED](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables) and [STATEMENT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables). This has been fixed for [MIXED](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables), but cannot be controlled by the replication for [STATEMENT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables) based replication.
* Inconsistent Slaves need to be set up again from the Master. ([MDEV-17614](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-17614))
* Wrong value on instantly added column can occur after [DELETE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/changing-deleting-data/delete) and a following [UPDATE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/changing-deleting-data/update) of PRIMARY KEY. ([MDEV-20066](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20066))
* INSTANT DROP COLUMN on an indexed column can result in a crash or data corruption. ([MDEV-20479](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20479))

### Can result in a hang or crash

* Replication could hang for [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) transactions as [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) has its own concurrency control innodb\_thread\_concurrency. ([MDEV-20247](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20247))
* Fix potential crash in ON UPDATE CASCADE when the foreign table is [system versioned](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/mariadb-enterprise-server-release-notes/mariadb-enterprise-server-10-4/system-versioned-table/README.md). ([MDEV-20311](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20311))

### Can result in unexpected behavior

* After setting [foreign\_key\_checks=0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#foreign_key_checks) it is possible to drop indexes from referenced (parent) tables, which could cause [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) to behave as if table `doesn't exist in engine` ([MDEV-17187](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-17187))
* Fix for corner case where [MariaDB Enterprise Backup](../../10-4/broken-reference/) could fail because encrypted data files could not be copied if created shortly before the backup was started. ([MDEV-18128](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-18128))
* [MariaDB Enterprise Backup](../../10-4/broken-reference/) could fail in the prepare face if the redo log is bigger than 512GB. ([MDEV-20060](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20060))
* If user enables encryption for temporary table and uses full\_crc32 format then temp table read may give error. ([MDEV-20340](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20340))

### Related to performance

* Optimized scanning of the undo log versions while scanning the secondary index versions. ([MDEV-20301](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20301))
* Improved performance for [mariadb-backup](../../10-4/broken-reference/) [--prepare](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/release-notes/enterprise-server/10-4/broken-reference/README.md) and [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) crash recovery, and the [InnoDB](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb) write performance. (MENT-139)

## Interface Changes

* [in\_predicate\_conversion\_threshold](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#in_predicate_conversion_threshold) system variable added
* [mysqld](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/starting-and-stopping-mariadb/mariadbd) [--in-predicate-conversion-threshold](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#in_predicate_conversion_threshold) command-line option added
