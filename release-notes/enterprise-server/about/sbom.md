# SBOM

MariaDB publishes a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each MariaDB Enterprise Server release. An SBOM lists the components that make up a build (libraries, packages, versions, licenses, and hashes); enabling customers to meet compliance requirements, perform vulnerability management, and understand supply chain risk.

## About

**Coverage:** Core MariaDB Enterprise Server binaries and packages for each supported platform/release

**Formats:** CycloneDX JSON (.json)

**Contents:** Component names & versions, suppliers, licenses, purls/CPEs (when available), cryptographic hashes, and dependencies

**Availability:** SBOM files are provided alongside each releaseâ€™s download artifacts in the customer portal, or from the "Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)" link on the [Enterprise Server download page](https://mariadb.com/downloads/enterprise/)

**Updates:** A new SBOM is published for every release; compare SBOMs across versions to see component deltas

## **Recommended Uses**

* **Vulnerability management:** Import the SBOM into a scanner or platform to match against advisories (e.g., OSV/CVE feeds)
* **Compliance & audits:** Produce component/license reports and demonstrate software composition controls
* **Change analysis:** Diff SBOMs between versions to identify updated/deprecated components
