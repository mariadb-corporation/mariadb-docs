# Differences in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.5

MariaDB Enterprise Server is a premium version of MariaDB Community Server that focuses on stability, robustness, and predictability.

MariaDB Enterprise Server enables a predictable development and operations experience through an enterprise lifecycle. This [enterprise lifecycle](../enterprise-server-lifecycle.md) incorporates optimized builds, predictable release behavior, and vendor support.

In addition to different release cycle, QA, and etc..., there are also feature differences. MariaDB Enterprise Server has different default settings to be more secure from the start and also only includes features that are fully supported and maintained.

In addition to this there are Enterprise Features and some backported features. The following are features that are in MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.5 but not in MariaDB Community Server 10.5:
