# Release Notes for MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.14-9

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/latest-es-10.6.md" %}

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.14-9 is a maintenance release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/README.md) 10.6. This release includes a variety of fixes. Users of MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-8 are encouraged to upgrade.

The next [scheduled maintenance release](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/faq/mariadb-software-questions/what-is-mariadbs-release-policy-and-schedule) for MariaDB Enterprise Server is 2023-09-11.

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.14-9 was released on 2023-06-13.

## Changes in Storage Engines

* This release originally incorporated MariaDB ColumnStore engine version [23.02.3](../../columnstore/23.02/23.02.3.md), and later contained [23.02.8](../../columnstore/23.02/23.02.8.md), [23.02.9](../../columnstore/23.02/23.02.9.md), and [23.02.10](../../columnstore/23.02/23.02.10.md).
* This release now incorporates MariaDB ColumnStore engine version [23.02.12](../../columnstore/23.02/23.02.12.md).

## Notable Changes

* InnoDB's internal performance has been improved. ([MDEV-30567](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30567))
* The [aria\_log\_dir\_path system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables) is added as read-only. ([MDEV-30971](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30971))
* The default value for the [core\_file system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#core_file) has been changed from None to OFF. ([MDEV-11356](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-11356))
* Starting with this release, the [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_buffer_pool_filename) is read-only and can't be changed dynamically. ([MDEV-30453](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30453))
  * In previous releases, when `innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown` was enabled, users with the `SUPER` privilege were able to dynamically change the value of the [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_buffer_pool_filename):

```sql
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_filename='SOME_FILE_PATH';
```

* Starting with this release, the [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_buffer_pool_filename) must be configured in a configuration file prior to starting up the server:

```
[mariadb]
innodb_buffer_pool_filename=SOME_FILE_PATH
```

* The [aria\_log\_dir\_path system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables) is added as read-only. ([MDEV-26153](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26153))\
  The `--aria-log-dir-path` command-line option is added to `mariadb-backup`.
* By default, [mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup) no longer prints messages about log scanning. ([MDEV-25765](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25765))
  * In previous releases, messages like the following could be printed excessively:

```
>> log scanned up to (LSN)
```

Starting with this release, the messages about log scanning are only printed when `--verbose` is enabled.

* Performance schema instruments are now available to monitor mutex contention in InnoDB's internal thread pool that is used for asynchronous data page I/O. ([MDEV-31048](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31048))
  * Starting with this release, the `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/tpool_cache_mutex` instrument can be enabled to track contention on the internal `tpool::cache::m_mtx mutex` in `read_slots` and `write_slots`.
  * When [performance\_schema](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/system-tables/performance-schema) is enabled, you can enable the `wait/synch/mutex/innodb/tpool_cache_mutex` instrument by changing the `ENABLED` column for the instrument in the [performance\_schema.setup\_instruments table](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-setup_instruments-table):

```sql
UPDATE performance_schema.setup_instruments
 SET ENABLED='YES'
 WHERE NAME='wait/synch/mutex/innodb/tpool_cache_mutex';
```

* When the instrument is enabled, details about mutex waits can be retrieved from other performance schema tables, such as [performance-schema.events\_waits\_current](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-events_waits_current-table), [performance-schema.events\_waits\_history](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-events_waits_history-table), and [performance-schema.events\_waits\_history\_long](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-events_waits_history_long-table).
* Enabling performance schema instrumentation can result in performance overhead, so extra care should be taken when enabling performance schema on production systems.
* InnoDB page flushing speed has been improved. ([MDEV-26827](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26827))
* The [Innodb\_buffer\_pool\_pages\_split status variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/innodb-status-variables) has been added to monitor page splits in the InnoDB buffer pool. ([MDEV-26827](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26827))
* When InnoDB's purge thread encounters a cached undo page that has not yet been re-used, the page is freed. This approach avoids some page writes and improves backup and restore performance. It also prevents the system tablespace or temporary tablespace from growing unnecessarily when they store undo log pages. ([MDEV-29593](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29593))

## Issues Fixed

### Can result in data loss

* When a backup is created with [mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup) and [aria\_log\_dir\_path](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/aria/aria-system-variables) is configured, the Aria logs are not copied to the backup. ([MDEV-30968](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30968))
* When system versioning is enabled for a table without a primary key, changes to the table are not properly replicated. ([MDEV-30430](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30430))
* When a partitioned table contains a prefix index on a column that uses a `NOPAD` collation, queries with `ORDER BY` can return rows in the wrong order. ([MDEV-30072](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30072))
* For some collations, when a unique constraint is defined with `UNIQUE(..) USING HASH`, duplicate values are accepted. ([MDEV-30034](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30034))
* When an InnoDB table with `ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT` is being rebuilt due to a DDL statement, the server can crash while trying to apply cached DML operations to the rebuilt table. ([MDEV-26198](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26198))
* Long uniques don't work correctly with `Unicode` collations. Equal strings (in terms of the collation) are compared as unequal if the length of the strings are different. ([MDEV-27653](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27653), [MDEV-28190](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28190))
* When [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_buffer_pool_filename) is set to the empty string, the server tries to delete the [datadir](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#datadir) during shutdown. ([MDEV-30453](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30453))
  * Starting with this release, the [innodb\_buffer\_pool\_filename system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_buffer_pool_filename) is read-only and can't be changed dynamically.
  * However, starting with MariaDB Community Server 10.9, the server rejects using numeric IDs to represent non-default character sets in binary logs. Replica servers using these newer versions would raise the following error message:

```
Unknown character set: '224'
```

* Starting with this release, the server writes the [character\_set\_client](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/server-system-variables#character_set_client) value to the binary log as a string instead of as a numeric ID. This change allows MariaDB Community Server 10.9 and later to connect as replica servers.
* When a [UNIQUE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-definition/create/create-table#unique) index includes a `PERIOD` in its definition, a duplicate key error can be incorrectly raised when the table uses the [utf8mb4\_unicode\_nopad\_ci collation](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-collation). ([MDEV-30415](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30415))
* With Galera, when a value is retrieved from an InnoDB sequence using the [NEXTVAL() function](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-structure/sequences/sequence-functions/nextval), the server can crash due to metadata lock conflicts between WSREP threads. ([MDEV-30413](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30413))
  * In previous releases, the following log message would be reported in the log prior to the crash:

```
[Note] WSREP: MDL BF-BF conflict
[ERROR] Aborting
```

### `Can result in a hang or crash`

* When an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` is rolled back from an InnoDB table with `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`, the server can crash. ([MDEV-30882](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30882))
* When the [LEFT() function](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/string-functions/left) is called on a string that has no character set defined, the server can crash. ([MDEV-30351](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30351))
* With Galera, when [wsrep\_sst\_method=mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables#wsrep_sst_method) is set and `encrypt=4` is enabled for State Snapshot Transfers (SSTs), SSTs can fail if the version of `socat` installed on the donor node is 1.7.4.0 or later. ([MDEV-30402](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30402))
  * In previous releases, SSTs could fail with the following error in the donor node's MariaDB error log if the version of socat installed is 1.7.4.0 or later:

```
E Failed to set SNI host ""
```

* Starting with this release, when the SST script starts the `socat` listener on the donor node, the error is prevented by setting `no-sni=1` if the version of `socat` installed is 1.7.4.0 or later.
* When optimizer trace is enabled, if a view is part of a multi-table update, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31085](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31085))
* When a view definition contains a `UNION` and the view is queried using server-side prepared statements, if the optimizer pushes down a condition into the execution of the view, the server can crash during character set conversions. ([MDEV-31102](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31102))
* When a replica server connects to a primary server with `MASTER_USE_GTID=slave_pos`, if the primary server has encrypted binary logs that it can no longer decrypt, the primary server crashes due to a segmentation fault. ([MDEV-28798](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28798))
  * In previous releases, the primary node would iterate over all of its binary logs to look for the requested GTID. When one of the binary logs could not be decrypted, the server would crash.
  * Starting with this release, when the primary node fails to decrypt a binary log in this scenario, it stops iterating over the binary logs and raises an error with the [ER\_MASTER\_FATAL\_ERROR\_READING\_BINLOG error code](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/mariadb-internals/using-mariadb-with-your-programs-api/error-codes/mariadb-error-codes-1200-to-1299/e1236) with the following error message:

```
Got fatal error 1236 from master when reading data from binary log: 'Could not set up decryption for binlog.'
```

* With Galera, when streaming replicating is enabled by setting the [wsrep\_trx\_fragment\_size system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables#wsrep_trx_fragment_size), the server can crash when certain fragment sizes are specified. ([MDEV-30838](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30838))
* When `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` is executed for a single-table `DELETE` that contains an `IN(..`) predicand, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31181](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31181))
* When parallel replication is enabled by setting [slave\_parallel\_threads](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/ha-and-performance/standard-replication/replication-and-binary-log-system-variables) greater than 0, the replica's parallel replication worker threads could hang after hitting an error. ([MDEV-30780](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30780))
* In previous releases, when the server was hung in this scenario, the output of `SHOW SLAVE STATUS` would show that an error occurred, but the output would indicate that both the I/O and SQL threads were running.

```sql
SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G
```

```
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                Slave_IO_State: Waiting for master to send event

..
```

* In this scenario, this issue causes one of the parallel replication worker threads to hang in the closing tables state, so the output of SHOW PROCESSLIST would show one worker thread in that state indefinitely:

```sql
SHOW PROCESSLIST;
```

```

..
+------+--------------+--------------------+------+--------------+-------+-----------------------------------------------+------------------+----------+
```

* When the optimizer chooses how to split a semi-join, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31403](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31403))
* With Galera, when `CREATE TEMPORARY SEQUENCE` is executed on a cluster node and binary logging is enabled, the server crashes. ([MDEV-25045](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25045))
* With Galera, when a write set fails certification and binary logging is enabled, the WSREP sequence numbers (cluster-wide transaction IDs) used by a WSREP applier thread can become out of sync with the node's XIDs (internal transaction IDs) due to a race condition, which can cause the node to crash. ([MDEV-27317](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27317))
  * In previous releases, when a write set failed certification and binary logging was enabled, a WSREP applier thread could sync the WSREP sequence number out-of-order, because the commit order could be released too early.
* With Galera, when streaming replicating is enabled by setting the [wsrep\_trx\_fragment\_size system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables#wsrep_trx_fragment_size) and `CREATE TABLE .. SELECT` is executed, the server can crash. The following assertion is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash: ([MDEV-30862](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30862))

```
Assertion `mode_ == m_high_priority' failed in void wsrep::client_state::after_applying()
```

* Starting with this release, the server prohibits CREATE TABLE .. SELECT in this scenario and raises the [ER\_NOT\_ALLOWED\_COMMAND error code](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/mariadb-internals/using-mariadb-with-your-programs-api/error-codes/mariadb-error-codes-1100-to-1199/e1148) with the following error message:

```
ERROR 42000: CREATE TABLE AS SELECT is not supported with streaming replication
```

* With Galera, when a connection uses the handler interface to start a transaction on a table, the server can crash when the client disconnects. ([MDEV-30955](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30955))\
  In previous releases, when the client disconnected, the server would rollback the transaction and release all locks, including the locks that the handler interface expected to survive after the transaction ended, which would cause the server to crash.
  * In previous releases, the following assertion is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash:

```
void close_thread_table(THD*, TABLE**): Assertion `thd->mdl_context.is_lock_owner(MDL_key::TABLE, table->s->db.str, table->s->table_name.str, MDL_SHARED)' failed.
```

* With Galera, when an SST donor changes to the non-primary state, the SST is not terminated properly, and the donor node crashes. (MENT-1708)
  * In previous releases, the following error message and assertion is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash:

```
[Warning] WSREP: server: NODE_NAME unallowed state transition: connected -> joined
void wsrep::server_state::state(wsrep::unique_lock<wsrep::mutex>&, wsrep::server_state::state): Assertion `0' failed.
```

* When a query is executed that uses `DISTINCT` and an aggregate function on a group, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31113](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31113))
* When a server-side prepared statement is used to execute a query that references views and contains a HAVING clause, the server can crash upon second execution of the query. ([MDEV-31189](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31189))
* When the InnoDB purge thread tries to use the change buffer for an uncommitted index, the server aborts with an assertion. ([MDEV-30076](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30076))
* When the `rowid_filtering` optimization is used with a partitioned table, the server aborts with an assertion. ([MDEV-30596](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30596))
* With Galera, a hang can occur in "starting" commit state due a deadlock between a `KILL` command and an abort issued by an applier. (MENT-1855)
  * Starting with this release, Total Order Isolation (TOI) is not used for the `KILL` command.
* When a backup is prepared with [mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup), the utility can hang due to a race condition between the thread flushing the buffer pool and the thread deleting the redo log file. ([MDEV-30860](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30860))
* With Galera, when a transaction changes multiple tables that use different storage engines, some of which support the server's internal 2-phase commit protocol and some of which don't support it, the node crashes with an assertion failure. ([MDEV-30804](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30804))
  * In previous releases, the following assertion failure is written to the MariaDB error log during the crash in this scenario:

```
int wsrep::transaction::ordered_commit(): Assertion `state() == s_committing' failed.
```

* Starting with this release, when Galera is enabled, mixed transactions are rejected in with the following error message:

```
ERROR HY000: Transactional commit not supported by involved engine(s)
```

* When InnoDB uses a lot of memory during crash recovery, the server can hang due to a race condition between the thread flushing the buffer pool and the thread performing the recovery. ([MDEV-30551](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30551))
* With Galera, when streaming replicating is enabled by setting the [wsrep\_trx\_fragment\_size system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3VYeeVGUV4AMqrA3zwy7/reference/galera-cluster-system-variables#wsrep_trx_fragment_size), the server can crash when backup locks or user-level locks are released. ([MDEV-25037](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25037))
* With the InnoDB storage engine, when [innodb\_undo\_log\_truncate=ON](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_undo_log_truncate) is set, the server can hang. ([MDEV-31343](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31343))
* When processing a query with the [ROWNUM() function](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/rownum), if the query uses in its `FROM` list a reference to a mergeable view, defined as `SELECT`, for more than one table that contains an `ORDER BY` clause, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31162](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31162))
* When an InnoDB table uses `ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`, the server can hang when splitting a page. ([MDEV-31158](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31158))
* When processing a query executing the [ROWNUM() function](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/rownum) on a mergeable view with ORDER BY, under certain conditions checked in the preparation phase, it may be decided to materialize the view rather than merging it. In this case, the `derived` field of the `TABLE_LIST` structure created for the view remained equal to `0`. As a result, the guard condition preventing range parsing for materialized views did not work as expected, causing the server to crash. ([MDEV-31143](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31143))
* When DDL is performed on an InnoDB table, the server can hang due to a deadlock between the DDL operation and the purge of InnoDB history. ([MDEV-31132](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31132))
* When processing a query executing the [ROWNUM() function](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/secondary-functions/information-functions/rownum) on a view, the server can crash. ([MDEV-31073](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31073))
* With the [InnoDB storage engine](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb), [DROP TABLE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-definition/drop/drop-table) can cause I/O errors if the number of data files exceeds the limit specified in the [innodb\_open\_files system variable](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_open_files). ([MDEV-31049](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-31049))
* When InnoDB tablespace encryption is enabled and [DROP TABLE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-definition/drop/drop-table) is executed, the server can crash due to a race condition between the background drop thread and the background encryption threads. ([MDEV-29273](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29273))
* With the [InnoDB storage engine](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb), a race condition between DDL and [INSERT](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/inserting-loading-data/insert) on a full-text table could cause the server to crash. ([MDEV-25984](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-25984))

([MDEV-29545](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29545))
* When an [UPDATE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-statements/data-manipulation/changing-deleting-data/update) is executed on an InnoDB table, transactions can hang due to a race condition. ([MDEV-27701](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-27701))
* With parallel replication, performance schema can contain inconsistent details about worker threads when the worker threads are starting up. ([MDEV-26071](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26071))
* When using the [InnoDB storage engine](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb), the execution of queries that use secondary indexes may slow down significantly. ([MDEV-30357](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30357))
  * Prior to this release (starting with 10.6.8), the performance of queries using secondary indexes could be affected by code that implements locking reads from secondary indexes.
  * Starting with this release, the condition that was causing the performance degradation has been removed, so locking transactions that did not modify any persistent tables can have a transaction ID of `0`
* After writing to InnoDB temporary tables, space in the InnoDB temporary tablespace is not reclaimed. ([MDEV-26782](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26782))
* When [innodb\_adaptive\_flushing](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_adaptive_flushing) is enabled, adaptive flushing is not always invoked after crossing [innodb\_adaptive\_flushing\_lwm](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/storage-engines/innodb/innodb-system-variables#innodb_adaptive_flushing_lwm). ([MDEV-26055](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26055))
* When creating a backup with [mariadb-backup](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/backing-up-and-restoring-databases/mariadb-backup), the utility can fail to copy the Aria log file when there is a gap in logs. (MENT-1587)
  * In previous releases, the backup log could contain messages like the following:

```
Found aria log file: aria_log.00000001, current: 1, min: 1, max: 1
Found aria log file: aria_log.00000004, current: 4, min: 1, max: 4
