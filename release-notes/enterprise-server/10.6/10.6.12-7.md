# Release Notes for MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7

{% include "../../.gitbook/includes/latest-es-10.6.md" %}

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7 is a maintenance release of [MariaDB Enterprise Server](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-release-notes/blob/test/en/mariadb-enterprise-server/README.md) 10.6. This release includes a variety of fixes.

MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7 was released on 2023-03-13.

Users of MariaDB Enterprise Server 10.6.12-7 are encouraged to upgrade to 10.6.12-8. Please see the [special upgrade procedure](10.6.12-8.md#upgrade-procedure) that must be used.

## Backported Features

MariaDB Enterprise Server enables a predictable development and operations experience through an [enterprise lifecycle](../enterprise-server-lifecycle.md). These new features have been backported after reaching maturity in MariaDB Community Server.

* In previous releases, the number of undo logs was configurable before InnoDB was initialized. With this release, the number of undo logs can also be configured after install.
  * The number of undo logs is configured by the InnoDB system variable `--innodb-undo-tablespaces`.
  * Splitting undo logs over multiple tablespaces can reduce the size of a single tablespace, especially the InnoDB system tablespace.
  * In previous releases, the number of undo logs had to be configured before InnoDB was initialized, so changing the number of undo logs would require setting up a new server instance. With this backport from MariaDB Community Server 10.11, the number of undo logs can be changed so it will take effect with the next server start. (MENT-1650)

## Notable Changes

* Output for the [JSON\_DETAILED()](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/special-functions/json-functions/json_detailed) function has been optimized to reduce the number of lines needed. ([MDEV-19160](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19160))
  * For compatibility, [JSON\_PRETTY()](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/special-functions/json-functions/json_pretty) has been added as an alias to JSON\_DETAILED(). ([MDEV-19160](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-19160))
* This release incorporates Galera library version 26.4.14.
* The names used by `information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION.NAME` for undo tablespaces have been changed. ([MDEV-30119](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30119))\
  Starting with this release, names for the undo tablespaces use the format undo001.\
  In previous releases, names for the undo tablespaces used `NULL`.
* For MariaDB Enterprise Cluster SST with `MariaDB Enterprise Backup` backup execution (namely the block DDL phase) has been changed. In previous releases, the node was paused from the cluster, generating the following log file entry: ([MDEV-26391](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26391))

```
WSREP: Shifting SYNCED -> DONOR/DESYNCED
```

* Starting with this release, the mariadb-backup execution can be aborted if DDL statements happen during backup execution. This abortable backup execution is the optional feature which can be enabled/disabled by `wsrep_mode: BF_ABORT_mariadb-backup`

## Issues Fixed

#### Can result in data loss

* When executing a `DELETE` or `UPDATE` with a subselect, the server can crash. ([MDEV-10087](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10087))

* During recovery, MariaDB Server can crash with an error when a DDL operation was executed before the server was stopped: `InnoDB: Trying to write ... bytes at ... outside the bounds of the file ...` ([MDEV-30069](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30069))
* `innodb_undo_log_truncate=ON` is not crash safe. This also can have effects for MariaDB Enterprise Backup for backup and restore. ([MDEV-29999](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29999), [MDEV-30179](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30179), [MDEV-30438](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30438))

```
FATAL ERROR: ... failed to copy datafile.
```

#### Can result in a hang or crash

* When executing `REPLACE INTO ... PARTITION(...)`, the server can crash. ([MDEV-29636](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29636))
* `Galera SST` doesn't properly handle undo\* files from InnoDB. As a result, SST may terminate incorrectly when `--innodb-undo-tablespaces` is set to 3 or more. ([MDEV-30157](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30157))
* With a query containing nested `WINDOW` clauses, the server can crash. ([MDEV-30052](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30052))
* When executing a `SELECT` from complex a view with `WHERE` clause and with the setting `derived_merge=on`, the server can crash. ([MDEV-30081](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30081))
* Infinite sequence of recursive calls when processing embedded CTE, when such a reference has the same table name as the name of the `CTE`. ([MDEV-30248](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30248))
* With a cluster wide conflict, MariaDB Enterprise Cluster can hang if a `binlog` purging is running (such as in the case that, binlog expiration is configured). ([MDEV-29512](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29512))
* `mariadbd` hangs when running with `--wsrep-recover` and `--plugin-load-add=ha_spider.so` options. ([MDEV-30370](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30370))
* After a second execution via a stored routine or a prepared statement of a `LEAD ... OVER` query, the server can crash. ([MDEV-28206](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28206))
* When `innodb_undo_log_truncate=ON` is set, the server can hang. ([MDEV-30180](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30180))
* After recovery, the server can crash with an error if `innodb_buffer_pool_size` is not large enough to recover in a single batch: `InnoDB: Tried to read ... bytes at offset` ([MDEV-30132](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30132))
* Race condition in foreign key locking during truncate. ([MDEV-29504](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29504))
* Possible hangs in some `B-tree` operations. ([MDEV-30400](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30400), [MDEV-29603](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29603))

* While executing an `ALTER TABLE` for a compressed `InnoDB` table, the server can crash. ([MDEV-28797](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-28797))
* InnoDB fails to remove a newly created table or index from data dictionary and table cache and then crashes, if the `ALTER` to add a `FULLTEXT` index fails in the commit phase. ([MDEV-30393](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30393))
* When the query cache is enabled and a `DROP DATABASE` is called, the `DROP DATABASE` can hang and 100 percent CPU load can be seen. ([MDEV-29760](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29760))
* The execution of `FLUSH TABLES...FOR EXPORT` can result in a server crash. ([MDEV-30227](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30227))
* When querying a Spider table from a stored procedure inside a `WHILE` clause, the server can crash. The stored procedure needs to use two `WHILE` clauses which both query the Spider table. ([MDEV-30191](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30191))
* Deadlock on `Replica` during `BACKUP STAGE BLOCK_COMMIT on XA` transactions. ([MDEV-30423](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30423))

* When querying a table with virtual generated columns using full text search, these columns are not generated and are always `NULL` in the result set. ([MDEV-29169](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29169))
* Identifiers are not quoted for the output of `SHOW GRANTS`. Using the result to execute the grant statement results in a syntax error, if reserved keywords are used. ([MDEV-30056](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-30056))

* `seconds_behind_master` is incorrect for delayed parallel replicas. ([MDEV-29639](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29639))

* Calling `DETERMINISTIC` package functions from other SQL/PL stored routines can be slow. ([MDEV-29370](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-29370))
* An upgrade to MariaDB Server 10.5 and [MariaDB 10.6](../../community-server/mariadb-10-6-series/what-is-mariadb-106.md) incorrectly reports that a recovery is needed. ([MDEV-24412](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-24412))
