### Known Limitations

If you are upgrading from version 8.7.20 or earlier, you must take into account an incompatibility related to Jetty
configuration, which was introduced in GridGain 8.7.21.

Your setup may be affected if:

- You're using the `ignite-rest-http` module (e.g. to connect to GridGain Web Console)
- You have a custom Jetty configuration that enables SSL for REST
- Your Jetty configuration uses the `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory` class
- The keystore specified in the Jetty configuration contains both the CA certificate and the private certificate

In this case, after starting the new version, you'll see an error similar to:

```text
java.lang.IllegalStateException: KeyStores with multiple certificates are not supported on the base class
org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory. (Use org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server
or org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Client instead)
```

To workaround this issue, you need to alter the Jetty configuration to use `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server`
or `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Client`.
For a configuration example, see [Client Certificate Authentication](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/latest/administrators-guide/security/authentication#client-certificate-authentication).
