# GridGain 8.9.12 Release Notes

## Overview

GridGain 8.9.12 includes multiple updates to GridGain libraries and improvements to data center replication.

## New Features

### Partial CSV Import

When importing data from CSV files by using the `COPY INTO` command, you can now choose specific columns and column order to import. The behavior of the import command depends on if the CSV file has the header or not. For example, lets take the following command:

```
COPY INTO TABLE(name, age) FROM "file.csv" FORMAT CSV
```

- If the CSV file has a header, CSV columns `name` and `age` will be imported into `name` and `age` table columns.
- If the CSV file does not have a header, the first two columns of the CSV file will be imported into `name` and `age` table columns.

## Installation and Upgrade Information

See the [Rolling Upgrades](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/latest/administrators-guide/rolling-upgrades) page for information about how to perform automated upgrades and for details about version compatibility.

### Migrating From GridGain 8.9.0

GridGain 8.9.1 introduced a large number of changes in default configuration values. Your setup may be affected if you are using default configuration.

When migrating to GridGain 8.10, make sure to check [Changed Default Values in GridGain 8.9.1 and Later](#changed-default-values-in-gridgain-8.9.1-and-later) section for any parameters you need to change.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Rolling upgrade is only possible if all nodes in the cluster have the `IGNITE_EVENT_DRIVEN_SERVICE_PROCESSOR_ENABLED` property manually set to the same value. This change affects the service framework used by GridGain, and different framework versions are not compatible. Due to the change to the default value, rolling upgrade will fail unless actions are taken.
{% endhint %}

### Migrating From GridGain 8.X

When migrating from GridGain 8.8 to GridGain 8.9, no special actions are required for core functionality migration. By using [rolling upgrades](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain8/latest/installation-guide/rolling-upgrades), you can update from any GridGain version listed below. You may need to perform minor configuration changes to ensure stability post migration.

{% hint style="info" %}
While updates from GridGain 8.7.X and earlier 8.8.X versions are possible, they may require additional actions to your configuration and  depending on cumulative changes in the version.
{% endhint %}

- If you are using GridGain Enterprise or Ultimate, the `COPY` command was reworked as described in the COPY Command Changes section. The syntax for working with CSV remains the same, but the path is now calculated on the **node** and the client. This change does not affect GridGain Community edition.

  To disable this behavior and use the old copy command, pass the `disabledFeatures=SERVER_BULK_LOAD` parameter in the JDBC connection command:

  ```
  jdbc:ignite:thin://127.0.0.1/?disabledFeatures=SERVER_BULK_LOAD
  ```

- If you are using one of the optional modules listed in the Removed Modules section, they will continue to work, but compatibility and stability on GridGain 8.9 is not guaranteed. Consider using the alternatives:
  - Visor CMD and GUI can be replaced by [GridGain Control Center](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/overview#system-requirements).
  - The spark module can be replaced by the Spark [Ignite Extension](https://github.com/apache/ignite-extensions).
- If you are using default values in your configuration, you may need to set them manually to keep you cluster working the same way as in previous versions. Make sure to check [Changed Default Values in GridGain 8.9.1 and Later](#changed-default-values-in-gridgain-8.9.1-and-later) section for any parameters you need to change.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rolling upgrade is only possible if both nodes have the `IGNITE_EVENT_DRIVEN_SERVICE_PROCESSOR_ENABLED` property manually set to the same value. Due to the change to the default value, rolling upgrade will fail unless actions are taken.
{% endhint %}

`2.11.1`, `2.12.0`, `2.13.0`,  `2.14.0`,  `2.15.0`

### Known Limitations

#### Changed Permissions for Control Center Agent in GridGain 8.9.4 and Later

GridGain 8.9.4 introduced stricter permissions checking for Control Center Agent. When running secured clusters, some actions that previously were available without permissions, will now require additional permissions.

Before updating, make sure to provide the [required permissions](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/control-center/latest/gg8/auth/authorization-permissions), otherwise some actions may become unavailable.

#### New TRACING_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE Permission in GridGain 8.9.2 and Later

GridGain 8.9.2 introduced the `TRACING_CONFIGURATION_UPDATE` [permission](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain8/latest/administrators-guide/security/authorization-permissions). If you were using security on a cluster before updating to this version, make sure that you provide the permissions to control utilities or users who need to update cluster permissions. Otherwise, they will not be able to update

#### Changed Default Values in GridGain 8.9.1 and Later

{% hint style="danger" %}
The change to `IGNITE_EVENT_DRIVEN_SERVICE_PROCESSOR_ENABLED` prevents rolling upgrade from earlier versions to GridGain 8.9.1 unless the value is manually configured to be `false`. For more information on changing service processor implementation, see [Services](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain8/latest/developers-guide/services/services#new-igniteservices-framework) documentation.
{% endhint %}

If you are updating from GridGain 8.8.X or 8.9.0, a large number of default values have been changed.

These changes may affect the stability or performance of your cluster if you are using default values.

We recommend checking the list below to make sure the changes do not have an adverse effect, and setting the value manually if necessary.

- Service processor now use event-driven implementation by default. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `IGNITE_EVENT_DRIVEN_SERVICE_PROCESSOR_ENABLE` property to `false`. Make sure that all nodes in the cluster are set to the same value. See [Services](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain8/latest/developers-guide/services/services#new-igniteservices-framework) documentation for more information.
- Data region metrics are now enabled by default. This may have a minor (within 2%) adverse effect on performance. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `DataRegionConfiguration.metricsEnabled` value to `false`.
- Data storage metrics are now enabled by default. This may have a minor (within 2%) adverse effect on performance. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `DataStorageConfiguration.metricsEnabled` value to `false`.
- `TcpCommunicationSpi` communication protocol now has a limit of 4096 messages for the outgoing messages queue by default.
- Atomic operations are now not allowed in transactions by default. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `IGNITE_ALLOW_ATOMIC_OPS_IN_TX` value to `true`.
- Logs are now in verbose mode by default. You can use the `-q` command line argument in the `ignite.sh` script to keep current log behavior.
- SQL queries are now loaded lazily by default. This reduces memory consumption on medium and large queries and potentially improves garbage collection performance. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `SqlFieldsQuery.setLazy(false)`.
- Cache entries are now read from primary partitions by default, even if an entry is available on the node in a backup partition. This may have a minor performance impact, but significantly increases cluster stability. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `readFromBackup` property to `true`.
- Partition map exchange transactions now time out after 1 minute instead of 0 (infinite) by default. You can keep the old timeout by setting the `TX_TIMEOUT_ON_PARTITION_MAP_EXCHANGE` setting to 0.
- Data streamer now overwrites entries by default. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `stmr.allowOverwrite` property to `false`.
- TCP discovery now uses static IP finder `TcpDiscoveryVmIpFinder` by default. To keep the old behavior, set the IP finder to use [multicast IP finder](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/gridgain8/latest/developers-guide/clustering/tcp-ip-discovery#multicast-ip-finder).
- Checkpointing process now starts upon reaching 75% of `minWalArchiveSize` instead of 25%. You can keep the old behavior by setting the `IGNITE_CHECKPOINT_TRIGGER_ARCHIVE_SIZE_PERCENTAGE` system variable to `0.25`.

#### Jetty Configuration Incompatibility in GridGain 8.7.21 and Later

If you are upgrading from version 8.7.20 or earlier, consider an incompatibility issue related to Jetty configuration introduced in GridGain 8.7.21.

Your setup may be affected if:

- You use the `ignite-rest-http` module (e.g. to connect to GridGain Web Console)
- You have a custom Jetty configuration that enables SSL for REST
- Your Jetty configuration uses the `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory` class
- The keystore specified in the Jetty configuration contains both the CA certificate and the private certificate

In this case, after starting a new version, an exception is thrown with an error message similar to the following:

```text
java.lang.IllegalStateException: KeyStores with multiple certificates are not supported on the base class
org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory. (Use org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server
or org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Client instead)
```

To workaround this issue, alter the Jetty configuration to use `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server` or `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Client`.
See the configuration example at the [Client Certificate Authentication](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/latest/administrators-guide/security/authentication#client-certificate-authentication) page.

#### Default `rebalanceThreadPoolSize` in GridGain 8.7.26 and Later

In GridGain 8.7.26, the default value of the property `IgniteConfiguration.rebalanceThreadPoolSize` changed from `1` to `min(4, number of CPU / 4)`.
It may cause a compatibility issue under the following conditions:

- When a Rolling Upgrade is performed
- The upgrade is performed from 8.5.7 version (or earlier) to 8.5.x or from 8.7.3 (or earlier) to 8.7.x
- The server nodes have at least 8 CPU cores
- The nodes configuration does not have the property `IgniteConfiguration.rebalanceThreadPoolSize`, so the default value is used

In this case, an exception is thrown with an error message similar to the following:

```text
сlass org.apache.ignite.IgniteException: Rebalance configuration mismatch (fix configuration or set -DIGNITE_SKIP_CONFIGURATION_CONSISTENCY_CHECK=true system property).
Different values of such parameter may lead to rebalance process instability and hanging.  [rmtNodeId=5fc58fb7-209d-489a-8034-0127a81abed6, locRebalanceThreadPoolSize = 4, rmtRebalanceThreadPoolSize = 1]
```

To workaround this issue, change the configuration of the server nodes to `rebalanceThreadPoolSize=1` so that it matches
the previous default configuration. For example:

```xml
<bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration">
    <property name="rebalanceThreadPoolSize" value="1"/>

    <!-- The rest of the configuration goes here -->
</bean>
```

#### Jetty Doesn't Accept Incorrect Configuration in GridGain 8.7.31 and Later

In GridGain 8.7.31 Jetty was upgraded to 9.4.33. Starting that version, Jetty has more strict validation of the
provided configuration files. Before that version, an incorrectly spelled property in the configuration file had no effect.
Starting this version, errors in the configuration will lead to an error on start.

Your setup may be affected if:

- You use the `ignite-rest-http` module (e.g. to connect to GridGain Web Console)
- You have a custom Jetty configuration for REST
- The custom configuration has errors in it

You will need to fix the custom Jetty configuration before upgrading.

#### `ignite.sh` No Longer Enables Remote JMX by Default in GridGain 8.7.31 and Later

Starting from 8.7.31 version, GridGain no longer attempts to automatically enable the remote JMX.
Default settings are known to cause issues if customized (for example, secure the connection).
Also, in most cases, remote JMX is not required since many tools use local JMX connections (not using TCP).

Your setup may be affected if:

- You start GridGain nodes via `ignite.sh` script
- You connect to GridGain nodes' JMX interface remotely over TCP using the default configuration

To continue using remote JMX, you need to manually specify the required JMX settings.
Please see the example below.
Note that you don't need remote JMX if you use a local connection,
such as connecting JConsole to a GridGain process on the same host.

```bash
export JVM_OPTS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=33333 \
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"

bin/ignite.sh
```

#### .NET: GridGain Nuget Package Misses GridGain.Ignite Jars in 8.8.17 and Later

Starting with GridGain 8.8.17, the `GridGain.Ignite` dependency is not included in the Nuget package. To use GridGain in your project, make sure to include the dependency explicitly so that jars from it are included.
