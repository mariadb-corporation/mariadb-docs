### Known Limitations

#### Jetty Configuration Incompatibility in GridGain 8.7.21 and Later

If you are upgrading from version 8.7.20 or earlier, consider an incompatibility issue related to Jetty configuration introduced in GridGain 8.7.21.

Your setup may be affected if:

- You use the `ignite-rest-http` module (e.g. to connect to GridGain Web Console)
- You have a custom Jetty configuration that enables SSL for REST
- Your Jetty configuration uses the `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory` class
- The keystore specified in the Jetty configuration contains both the CA certificate and the private certificate

In this case, after starting a new version, an exception is thrown with an error message similar to the following:

```text
java.lang.IllegalStateException: KeyStores with multiple certificates are not supported on the base class
org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory. (Use org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server
or org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Client instead)
```

To workaround this issue, alter the Jetty configuration to use `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server` or `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Client`.
See the configuration example at the [Client Certificate Authentication](https://www.gridgain.com/docs/latest/administrators-guide/security/authentication#client-certificate-authentication) page.

#### Default `rebalanceThreadPoolSize` in GridGain 8.7.26 and Later

In GridGain 8.7.26, the default value of the property `IgniteConfiguration.rebalanceThreadPoolSize` changed from `1` to `min(4, number of CPU / 4)`.
It may cause a compatibility issue under the following conditions:

- When a Rolling Upgrade is performed
- The upgrade is performed from 8.5.7 version (or earlier) to 8.5.x or from 8.7.3 (or earlier) to 8.7.x
- The server nodes have at least 8 CPU cores
- The nodes configuration does not have the property `IgniteConfiguration.rebalanceThreadPoolSize`, so the default value is used

In this case, an exception is thrown with an error message similar to the following:

```text
сlass org.apache.ignite.IgniteException: Rebalance configuration mismatch (fix configuration or set -DIGNITE_SKIP_CONFIGURATION_CONSISTENCY_CHECK=true system property).
Different values of such parameter may lead to rebalance process instability and hanging.  [rmtNodeId=5fc58fb7-209d-489a-8034-0127a81abed6, locRebalanceThreadPoolSize = 4, rmtRebalanceThreadPoolSize = 1]
```

To workaround this issue, change the configuration of the server nodes to `rebalanceThreadPoolSize=1` so that it matches
the previous default configuration. For example:

```xml
<bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration">
    <property name="rebalanceThreadPoolSize" value="1"/>

    <!-- The rest of the configuration goes here -->
</bean>
```

#### Jetty Doesn't Accept Incorrect Configuration in GridGain 8.7.31 and Later

In GridGain 8.7.31 Jetty was upgraded to 9.4.33. Starting that version, Jetty has more strict validation of the
provided configuration files. Before that version, an incorrectly spelled property in the configuration file had no effect.
Starting this version, errors in the configuration will lead to an error on start.

Your setup may be affected if:

- You use the `ignite-rest-http` module (e.g. to connect to GridGain Web Console)
- You have a custom Jetty configuration for REST
- The custom configuration has errors in it

You will need to fix the custom Jetty configuration before upgrading.

#### `ignite.sh` No Longer Enables Remote JMX by Default in GridGain 8.7.31 and Later

Starting from 8.7.31 version, GridGain no longer attempts to automatically enable the remote JMX.
Default settings are known to cause issues if customized (for example, secure the connection).
Also, in most cases, remote JMX is not required since many tools use local JMX connections (not using TCP).

Your setup may be affected if:

- You start GridGain nodes via `ignite.sh` script
- You connect to GridGain nodes' JMX interface remotely over TCP using the default configuration

To continue using remote JMX, you need to manually specify the required JMX settings.
Please see the example below.
Note that you don't need remote JMX if you use a local connection,
such as connecting JConsole to a GridGain process on the same host.

```bash
export JVM_OPTS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=33333 \
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false"

bin/ignite.sh
```

#### .NET: GridGain Nuget Package Misses GridGain.Ignite Jars in 8.8.17 and Later

Add the `GridGain.Ignite` dependency to your project, so that jars from it are included.

#### .NET: Docker Images Need Additional Configuration

To run .NET SDK commands, install the .NET SDK. For more details, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60#dependencies).
