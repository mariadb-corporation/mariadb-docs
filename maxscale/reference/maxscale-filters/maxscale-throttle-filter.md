# MaxScale Throttle Filter

## Throttle

### Overview

The throttle filter is used to limit the maximum query frequency (QPS - queries
per second) of a database session to a configurable value. The main use cases
are to prevent a rogue session (client side error) and a DoS attack from
overloading the system.

The throttling is dynamic. The query frequency is not limited to an absolute
value. Depending on the configuration the throttle will allow some amount of
high frequency queries, or especially short bursts with no frequency limitation.

### Configuration

#### Basic Configuration

```
[Throttle]
type = filter
module = throttlefilter
max_qps = 500
throttling_duration = 60000
...

[Routing-Service]
type = service
filters = Throttle
```

This configuration states that the query frequency will be throttled to around
500 qps, and that the time limit a query is allowed to stay at the maximum
frequency is 60 seconds. All values involving time are configured in
milliseconds. With the basic configuration the throttling will be nearly
immediate, i.e. a session will only be allowed very short bursts of high
frequency querying.

When a session has been continuously throttled for `throttling_duration`
milliseconds, or 60 seconds in this example, MaxScale will disconnect the
session.

#### Allowing high frequency bursts

The two parameters `max_qps` and `sampling_duration` together define how a
session is throttled.

Suppose max qps is 400 qps and sampling duration is 10 seconds. Since QPS is not
an instantaneous measure, but one could say it has a granularity of 10 seconds,
we see that over the 10 seconds 10\*400 = 4000 queries are allowed before
throttling kicks in.

With these values, a fresh session can start off with a speed of 2000 qps, and
maintain that speed for 2 seconds before throttling starts.

If the client continues to query at high speed and throttling duration is set to
10 seconds, Maxscale will disconnect the session 12 seconds after it started.

### Settings

#### `max_qps`

* Type: number
* Mandatory: Yes
* Dynamic: Yes

Maximum queries per second.

This is the frequency to which a session will be limited over a given time
period. QPS is not measured as an instantaneous value but over a configurable
sampling duration (see `sampling_duration`).

#### `throttling_duration`

* Type: [duration](../../maxscale-archive/archive/mariadb-maxscale-25-01/mariadb-maxscale-25-01-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-2501-maxscale-2501-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide.md)
* Mandatory: Yes
* Dynamic: Yes

This defines how long a session is allowed to be throttled before MaxScale
disconnects the session.

#### `sampling_duration`

* Type: [duration](../../maxscale-archive/archive/mariadb-maxscale-25-01/mariadb-maxscale-25-01-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-2501-maxscale-2501-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide.md)
* Mandatory: No
* Dynamic: Yes
* Default: 250ms

Sampling duration defines the window of time over which QPS is measured. This
parameter directly affects the amount of time that high frequency queries are
allowed before throttling kicks in.

The lower this value is, the more strict throttling becomes. Conversely, the
longer this time is, the longer bursts of high frequency querying is allowed.

#### `continuous_duration`

* Type: [duration](../../maxscale-archive/archive/mariadb-maxscale-25-01/mariadb-maxscale-25-01-getting-started/mariadb-maxscale-2501-maxscale-2501-mariadb-maxscale-configuration-guide.md)
* Mandatory: No
* Dynamic: Yes
* Default: 2s

This value defines what continuous throttling means. Continuous throttling
starts as soon as the filter throttles the frequency. Continuous throttling ends
when no throttling has been performed in the past `continuous_duration` time.
