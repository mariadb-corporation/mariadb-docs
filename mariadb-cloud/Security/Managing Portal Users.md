# Managing Portal Users

By default, SkySQL services are launched and managed in the [Portal](<../../Portal features/>).

For multiple SkySQL ID accounts to jointly manage a set of SkySQL services, these accounts can be added to a Team.

The User Management interface in the [Portal](<../../Portal features/>) is a self-service tool to manage your Team.

A Team can be managed by the initial user on the Team or by any Administrator added to the Team.

An email address can belong to only one SkySQL Team. If an email address is already in a Team, it cannot be added to another Team.

## **Access to User Management**

To access the User Management interface:

1. Log in to the [Portal](https://app.skysql.com/dashboard).
2. Click the "Settings" link in the main menu (left navigation in the Portal).
3. Click the [User Management](https://app.skysql.com/settings/user-management) button.
