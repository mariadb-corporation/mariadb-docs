# Hashicorp Key Management Plugin

The [Hashicorp Key Management Pugin](../../../server/security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/hashicorp-key-management-plugin.md) is used to implement encryption using keys stored in the Hashicorp Vault KMS.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information about configuring the plugin as well as different capabilities, please check the [documentation](../../../server/security/securing-mariadb/encryption/data-at-rest-encryption/key-management-and-encryption-plugins/hashicorp-key-management-plugin.md). This guide will cover a minimal example for configuring the plugin with the operator.

## Configuring MariaDB To Use Vault Secrets For Full Encryption.

MariaDB can be configured to encrypt all of it's components 

### Requirements

- Running and accessible Vault KMS setup with a valid SSL certificate.
- Vault is unsealed and you've logged in to it with `vault login $AUTH_TOKEN`, where $AUTH_TOKEN is an authentication token given to you by an administrator
- `openssl` for generating secrets

### Steps 

1. **Creating A New Key-Value Store In Vault.**
    Create a new key-value store and take note of the `path`. In our example we will use `mariadb`.
    ```sh
    vault secrets enable -path /mariadb -version=2 kv
    ```

2. **Adding necessary secrets.**
    We will put 2 secrets with ids `1` and `2`. `2` will be used for temporary files, while `1` will be used for everything else. It is not
    neccessary to create 2 of them and in that case, temporary files will use `1`.

    Note: Here you should use the `path` we chose in the previous step.
    ```sh
    vault kv put /mariadb/1 data="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    vault kv put /mariadb/2 data="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    ```

3. **(Optional) Create An Authentication Token.**
    This step can be skipped if you want to use your own token. Consult with a Vault administrator regarding this. If you want to create a new one:
    ```sh
    vault token create
    ```
    You will see output similar to:
    ```
    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                EXAMPLE_TOKEN
    token_accessor       9sHvwKiddpCT2PaplcHHRAnv
    token_duration       âˆž
    token_renewable      false
    token_policies       ["root"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["root"]
    ```
    Your new token is: `EXAMPLE_TOKEN`.

4. **Create A `Secret` For my.cnf**
    Now, because we will store a Vault authentication token in `my.cnf`, to facilitate encryption and gitops, we will put the `my.cnf` configuration in a separate `Secret` instead of having it directly as
    part of the spec. This way, you can encrypt the `Secret` and store it in git, or even create the `Secret` with an external tool.
    Note the `hashicorp-key-management-vault-ca`. We will configure that later on as a volumeMount.

    **mariadb-vault.yaml**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mariadb-vault
      labels:
        enterprise.mariadb.com/watch: ""
    stringData:
      my.cnf: |
        [mariadb]
        plugin_load_add = hashicorp_key_management
        hashicorp-key-management-vault-url=https://vault-0.vault-internal.default.svc.cluster.local:8200/v1/mariadb
        hashicorp-key-management-token=REPLACE_ME
        hashicorp-key-management-caching-enabled=ON
        hashicorp-key-management-vault-ca=/etc/vault/certs/ca.crt

        innodb_encrypt_tables = FORCE
        innodb_encrypt_log = ON
        innodb_encrypt_temporary_tables = ON
        encrypt_tmp_disk_tables = ON
        encrypt_tmp_files = ON
        encrypt_binlog = ON
        aria_encrypt_tables = ON

        innodb_encryption_threads = 4
        innodb_encryption_rotation_iops = 2000

    ```
    `kubectl apply -f mariadb-vault.yaml`

5. **Create a Secret for the tls certificate.**
    @TODO

5. **Create A MariaDB Custom Resource.**
    The final step is creating a new MariaDB instance.

    **mariadb-vault.yaml**
    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mariadb # Used to hold the mariadb and root user passwords
      labels:
        enterprise.mariadb.com/watch: ""
    stringData:
      password: MariaDB11!
      root-password: MariaDB11!
    ---
    apiVersion: enterprise.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
    kind: MariaDB
    metadata:
      name: mariadb
    spec:
      image: docker.mariadb.com/enterprise-server:11.4.7-4.3
      rootPasswordSecretKeyRef:
        name: mariadb
        key: root-password

      username: mariadb
      passwordSecretKeyRef:
        name: mariadb
        key: password
        generate: true
      database: mariadb

      port: 3306

      storage:
        size: 1Gi

      myCnf: |
        [mariadb]
        bind-address=*
        default_storage_engine=InnoDB
        binlog_format=row
        innodb_autoinc_lock_mode=2
        innodb_buffer_pool_size=800M
        max_allowed_packet=256M

      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi

      metrics:
        enabled: true

      volumes:
        - name: mariadb-vault
          secret:
            secretName: mariadb-vault
            defaultMode: 0600
        - name: vault-certificates
          secret:
            secretName: vault-tls
            defaultMode: 0600
      volumeMounts:
        - name: vault-certificates
          mountPath: /etc/vault/certs/
        - name: mariadb-vault
          mountPath: /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/
    ```
    `kubectl apply -f mariadb-vault.yaml`

6. **Verify Encryption Works.**
    ```sh
    kubectl run mariadb-connect --rm -it --image=mariadb:11.4 -- bash -c "mariadb -u root -p'MariaDB11!' --ssl=false -h mariadb"
    ```

    You should see something along the lines of:

    ```
    If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
    Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MariaDB connection id is 95
    Server version: 11.4.7-4-MariaDB-enterprise MariaDB Enterprise Server

    Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    MariaDB [(none)]>
    ```

    At this point, you can check the encryption status:
    ```sql
    SELECT * from information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION;
    ```

    If you create a new database and then table, the above query should return additional information about them.

## Day-2 Operations

### Rotating Secrets

1. **Put A New Secret In Vault.**
    After logging in to vault, you can run again:
    ```sh
    vault kv put /mariadb/1 data="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    vault kv put /mariadb/2 data="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
    ```
    This will start re-encrypting data.

2. **Monitor Re-Encryption.**
    ```sh
    kubectl run mariadb-connect --rm -it --image=mariadb:11.4 -- bash -c "mariadb -u root -p'MariaDB11!' --ssl=false -h mariadb"
    ```
    If you check the encrpytion status again:
    ```sql
    SELECT * from information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION;
    ```
    You should see `CURRENT_KEY_VERSION` column start getting updated to point to the new key version.

## Known Issues/Limitations

### **Vault Not Being Accessible Will Result In MariaDB Not Working**

As MariaDB uses vault to fetch it's decryption key, in the case where vault is not accessible due to it being down, network issues, secret
not existing, will result in MariaDB not being able to fetch the decryption key and hence stop working. While the Hashicorp plugin has a
configurable cache, that should be set and will result in MariaDB still working for a few seconds to minutes, depending on configuration,
the cache is not reliable as it's ephemeral and short lived.

### **Deleting The Decryption Key Will Make Your Data Inaccessible.**

It is recommended to back up the decryption key so accidental deletions will not result in issues.

### **Decryption Key Must Be Hexadecimal**

Use the following to generate correct decryption keys.
```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### **Rotating The Decryption Key Before A Previous Re-Encryption Has Finished, Will Result In Data Corruption.**
To check the re-encryption progress, you can run:

```sql
SELECT * from information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION;
```

Look for the `CURRENT_KEY_VERSION` and make sure they are in sync with the latest version you have in Vault.
